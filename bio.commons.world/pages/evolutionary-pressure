By now, the situation is becoming urgent, as very few effective drugs are left to treat infections. Antibiotic resistance development is a natural process. Bacteria are under selective pressure and evolve mechanisms to avoid the antimicrobial effects of the antibiotics. Once developed, the genes for the resistance then rapidly spread even cross over between different species - a process called horizontal gene transfer. It therefore is necessary to continuously develop new antibiotics to keep up pace with resistant bacteria. "
