      "text": "There are also a number of background reasons that people give (often in confidence), when I’ve discussed this topic with them. There is a perhaps surprisingly common apathy and even antagonism to democracy in general, and the focus of this target is often elected politicians, and the quality of the public debate which seems irrelevant to most peoples concerns. Voting is also associated with companies, and legal structures – which people tend to distrust.\n\nI’d like to deal with each of these points in turn, and give to the best of my ability the important counter arguments, most of which I feel are rarely stated. First that voting is confrontational. Voting can indeed be confrontational, but that is like saying “talk is ineffective”. It may be true, but it is not necessarily true. Indeed done well, voting is a good way of avoiding confrontation. Given a contentious topic, encouraging people to consider the arguments and then vote, can lead to more creative, positive, and far less confrontational dialogue.\n\nThis is particularly the case when technology allows the group to consider the debate in their own time, and vote in private, after the meeting. A well facilitated meeting conducted this way allows a far more playful and empathetic discussion to emerge without the immediate pressure of a decision. Without this pressure, there is less incentive for individuals to argue loudly and forcibly in an attempt to bully the less vocal members of the group into submission. Anonymous votes (where needed) can further discourage bullying. This is the fundamental power of a true anonymous ballot, in which the rich and powerful find it much harder to purchase votes or frighten people into voting their way, as there is no way for them to know which way the person the pressure actually votes. In conclusion while voting may not solve all cases of genuine conflict, done well it can be a useful tool to make group conversations less (not more) confrontational.\n\nSecond, the perception that voting takes time. Time out of the meeting, and time away from discussing important things. This is plain wrong. Before we had the internet and mobile phones, there is a case for this argument. Calling a vote takes perhaps 5 minutes, and if there are several topics on the agenda, voting on each one of them can take a significant amount of time. Even here historically however, this argument is weak. I cannot list the number of occasions both online and offline in which discussion go on without an end in site. A brief experience of consensus circles, or the experience of Occupy type gatherings, will quickly lead you to the conclusion that voting can be a real time saver. That is not to say that consensus is not an excellent tool that groups should use in many circumstances, but it is a clear and direct rebuttal to the argument that a good reason not to call a formal vote is that you don’t have time for a quick show of hands.\n\nMore importantly however in a modern context, having the facility to vote on particular topics can be a clear time-saver in meetings. Any group can set up simple online procedures for voting and follow up discussion using excellent open source tools such as Loomio or OneClickOrgs. This literally takes a couple of minutes. Once this is set up, there is no need to take up time in a meeting to actually vote, you can do that at home later, or indeed use your mobile phone any time that is convenient. This allows reflection, and frees up the meeting for more important things.\n\nThe third point is that voting is not needed. Again this is partly true, but this truth covers the more important truth that voting, when needed is a vital asset to almost any group. Many questions do not need formal votes, let’s accept that. Groups are not compelled to vote on every issue, and are free to deal quickly with such issues as they see fit. But every now and then, a contentious issue arises,, or more importantly an issue in which long open face-to-face discussion is difficult because of interpersonal issues, or perhaps the complexity and diversity of individual perspectives. It is rare for a group not to face problems when such topics come up, and when they do having access to a formal and previously agreed process to resolve them is essential. Voting is one of those tools. It is robust, generally accepted as fair, and has served the test of time. There may well be better, and more sophisticated techniques, but a simple vote takes a lot of beating.\n\nLastly – let’s deal with the argument that voting does not result in the best result. This is the most important counter argument. It has real merit. Choosing a respected individual to curate, direct or otherwise lead an initiative is often a better strategy to deliver quality, fast. If this is the case for the topic being considered then it is important not to mask this decision with a fake-democratic process. Classic examples of fake democratic processes are so called “open calls” in which everyone is invited to propose ideas and apply, but only a chosen few make the decisions. Consultations are another example. People should be rightly offended when repeatedly asked for their opinions only to be summarily ignored when it comes to making the decision.\n\nOn this last point there is much more to say. There are real advances in the field of bottom-up decision making, and while we have a long way to go actually building effective tools – projects such as Liquid Democracy, or strategies such as deliberative polling offer much promise."

Even here historically however, this argument is weak. I cannot list the number of occasions both online and offline in which discussion go on without an end in site. A brief experience of consensus circles, or the experience of Occupy type gatherings, will quickly lead you to the conclusion that voting can be a real time saver. That is not to say that consensus is not an excellent tool that groups should use in many circumstances, but it is a clear and direct rebuttal to the argument that a good reason not to call a formal vote is that you don’t have time for a quick show of hands.\n\nMore importantly however in a modern context, having the facility to vote on particular topics can be a clear time-saver in meetings. Any group can set up simple online procedures for voting and follow up discussion using excellent open source tools such as Loomio or OneClickOrgs. This literally takes a couple of minutes. Once this is set up, there is no need to take up time in a meeting to actually vote, you can do that at home later, or indeed use your mobile phone any time that is convenient. This allows reflection, and frees up the meeting for more important things.\n\nThe third point is that voting is not needed. Again this is partly true, but this truth covers the more important truth that voting, when needed is a vital asset to almost any group. Many questions do not need formal votes, let’s accept that. Groups are not compelled to vote on every issue, and are free to deal quickly with such issues as they see fit. But every now and then, a contentious issue arises,, or more importantly an issue in which long open face-to-face discussion is difficult because of interpersonal issues, or perhaps the complexity and diversity of individual perspectives. It is rare for a group not to face problems when such topics come up, and when they do having access to a formal and previously agreed process to resolve them is essential. Voting is one of those tools. It is robust, generally accepted as fair, and has served the test of time. There may well be better, and more sophisticated techniques, but a simple vote takes a lot of beating.\n\nLastly – let’s deal with the argument that voting does not result in the best result. This is the most important counter argument. It has real merit. Choosing a respected individual to curate, direct or otherwise lead an initiative is often a better strategy to deliver quality, fast. If this is the case for the topic being considered then it is important not to mask this decision with a fake-democratic process. Classic examples of fake democratic processes are so called “open calls” in which everyone is invited to propose ideas and apply, but only a chosen few make the decisions. Consultations are another example. People should be rightly offended when repeatedly asked for their opinions only to be summarily ignored when it comes to making the decision.\n\nOn this last point there is much more to say. There are real advances in the field of bottom-up decision making, and while we have a long way to go actually building effective tools – projects such as Liquid Democracy, or strategies such as deliberative polling offer much promise."
