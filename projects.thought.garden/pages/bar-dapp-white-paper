      "text": "In short: sponsors donate beer to a hackathon or a not for profit tech conference, guests of the hackathon receive beer tokens in exchange of a promise to help an opensource project of their choice. Beer tokens are exchanged for beers. reason to do all this stuff on the blockchain, and not just with beads or marbles, is that with a blockchain everyone will be able to see a symbolic history of these offers of help. A VERY important thing to say that it is not an incentive mechanism where someone pays people in beer in exchange of promises of help. Beer is rather symbolic thing there. People do help opensource projects already, but with the process we are suggesting it might be easier to discover new projects which can do with some help, and also for the projects to see that they have a lot of potential helpers and encourage them to publish not so ready code etc."

Beverage companies have developed multiple ways maximize value by connecting sponsored properties and consumers in nontraditional ways, and extending reach across multiple passion points. Beer consumption at events such as hackathons has demonstrated positive effect on team building and overall atmosphere. We propose to strengthen this dynamic by using a blockchain based token system which  seamlessly turns free beer into free software.\nWe show how blockchain paradigm combined with beer consumption at hackathons is dank and makes participants’ and beverage sponsors’ experience better: easy to start collaborations, more fun, potentially long term, and sponsorships more meaningful.\nWe discuss design and implementation of such system from social and technological perspective. Details about functional and tech specs are described in a separate document\n\n1. Introduction\n\nBeverage industry play an important role in software development and IT infrastructure, however in the area of decentralised technology, such as blockchain, it still remains in the shadows. We see names of companies in the area of finance, IoT, and since recently insurance and logistics associated with shiny blockchain projects, but not your favorite local brewery.\nPlatforms such as Github, make it easier to find and contribute to opensource projects one is excited about, however deprived of human interaction in meatspace. Hackathons sometimes spark longer collaborations, but the setting prioritise more outgoing people to quickly form teams. \nBeers, are consumed at hackathons, and by people who work on opensource projects. It is associated with having a good time and hanging out with people. \nBarDapp is a token system. Tokens can be redeemed for beer represent help that people offer to opensource projects. This representation is symbolic. And the transactions (redeeming tokens for beer at the bar) We explain why and how it is not a reward system in the section 1.2.\n\nBy design, the blockchain enforces transparency. Beverage companies would be able to show the number of transactions as their results of meaningful sponsorship. \nBlockchains offer a possibility to store the history without a need to maintain a poxy server.\n\n1.1. Driving Factors. There are three main goals of this project; make skill exchange easier and more fun, and remembered forever without any privacy breaches. Make sponsorship from beverage and other companies more meaningful and presentable. Make blockchains more dank. \nLarge beverage producers can afford sponsoring large events i.e football championships. Smaller local brewery will be able to support events in a cool way. Even when a small local unconference can create a long term collaborations in the future, it might pass unnoticed, at least for sponsors. \nWe aslo don’t really want some random corporates to push their APIs on us because of FOMA.\nOn top of that, we have to admit, that blockchains have created a lot of buzz, we might as well use this buzz to get better beer to small community events. \n\n1.2  Beer and blockchains to celebrate and remember collaboration, not as a poxy reward mechanism\n\nIt is important to note, that the system does not utilise beer as an incentive to contribute, because there is unlimited supply of beer in bars and supermarkets and because it is not the point at all and kills the magic.\n\nDedicating effort to opensource projects can’t and should not be measured in money, not even in beer, however, kudos can be symbolically represented by a transaction where tokens redeemed for beer in the case when a transaction is stored forever on the blockchain. Token thus transactions represent an offer to help open source projects which can’t be measured in either fiat or cryptographic currency.  Despite of beer being one of the first currencies (first known payslip - a clay tablet depicting the payment of beer to workers dating to between 3100BC and 3000BC, kept in the collection of the British Museum) we do not believe that rewarding people with beer is a viable system. This would open up for attacks in which beer drinking never finishes, rendering participants unable to move nor have a good time. Additionally, the return value of their contributions will be more like working for beer, not celebrating collaboration on the exciting opensource project because it is fun. Because it is important public infrastructure and commons that everyone will benefit from. This should be celebrated and marked on the blockchain. \n\nTo summarise, our research shows, that this underlying protocol is dank enough to make sure that free as in beer is converted into free as in freedom in a secure way which preserves decency and fun. We demonstrate it through assembling IKEA furniture example. For example inviting your friends for a beer after they have helped you to assemble IKEA furniture, doesn’t mean that you are paying them in beer and they wouldn’t have done it for free. They have done it because they like you and want you to finally have furniture in you flat, that you, them and other friends can use in the future. Inviting your friends for a beer before you start assembling IKEA furniture doesn’t mean that your friends are in beer furniture assembling debt. \nBeer component in both cases is a symbolic transaction which represents the fact that it’s not really work and everyone is having a good time while achieving something. \n\n1.3. Beverage companies sponsorship. The Institute of Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen, the birthplace of quantum mechanics, was created in 1921 with significant funding from the Carlsberg Foundation. \nMonetary support from other types of sponsors interested in promoting their brand to a particular demographic is frequently spent on beer and snacks.\n\n\n2. Overview of Functional Specifications\n\n2.1 Comparison with other concepts\nIn a pledge fund, the investors provide a loose commitment of capital to an investment team, the manager of the fund, to make investments within certain preset parameters.\nTime-based currency is an alternative currency or exchange system where the unit of account/value is the person-hour or some other time unit. While there are some good things about time bank systems, they are often criticised for being useless and not so fun i.e swap one hour of dishwashing to one hour of dogwalking, maintain a ledger of it all. \nWe combine these two concepts with blockchains and beer which makes it more dank. \n\n2.2  Database. BarDapp participants offer to help an opensource project of their choice that is represented at an event i.e hackathon or a conference. Projects in question are interviewed prior to the event to create a list of needs. They are encouraged to communicate what help they might need apart from technical so that people with no or little programming skills can contribute to the project . These offers of help constitute a form of social capital pledge fund. Parameters of the pledge fund are that the offers of help can be only utilised for opensource projects that can do with some help.  \n\n2.3 What if people would lie?\nMost cryptographic ledger projects take in the consideration that people lie, therefore utilising trustlessness to settle transactions. \nWhat if someone will promise to help me with a project just to get a lot of free beer and never do anything? We have thought of this attack vector, and we will have to live with it. If someone wants to go through a hassle of getting a free beer by lying, well this particular pint won’t be turned into free software. To compensate for it we have to make sure that we have enough beer in the system.  \n\n3. Technical Specifications \nRoadmap for the Bar Decentralised Application starting with only a few functionalities in beta and minimum user interface, and a future creation of a full blown decentralised organisation. \nAt no stage this system is trustless nor fully automated or autonomous. Nor it is game-theoretical. At all stages human collaboration and drinking beer together remain at the core of this socio-technological system. Blockchain is used because it is transparent and will preserve transactions as a symbolic representation of people helping each others projects and drinking beer together.\nBeta version consists of three parts - a token system powered by EVM and Ethereum blockchain, a database of offers of help and a bar. In subsequent versions we introduce a more sophisticated database with a key management system. token system and a database will be linked in an automated, more trustless way. Bar will remain in a meatspace. We do not plan to implement a turing complete version of a bar, because of security reasons. \n\n3.2 Beta release components\n\nToken contract\nDatabase\nPaper wallets \nA bar\n\n\n3.3 Choice of beer for the protocol layer explained\nPrevious experiences show how beer is utilised to increase knowledge and skills pertaining to computer software, hardware and data networks. C-base - remnants of the ancient space station crashed in what is now known as Berlin several billion years ago, introduced a discount on beers and club mate that can be purchased in the bar for the members working on the reconstruction of a space station. Members of c-base use the location to work on personal and collaborative projects related to the reconstruction of the space station and meet at the bar to relax, chill and stay informed about each other’s projects. Beer at C-base space station can be also purchased in an automated beer dispenser while no one is at the bar, because it is important to maintain constant beer supply at all times.\n\nApart from promoting happiness and being associated with celebration, moderate consumption improves sleep. Sleep is very important, and often disregarded within a geeky demographic. 12oz of beer has about 150 calories, has no fat, no caffeine, and rich in vitamin B. \n\n\n3.3 How offers for help are stored?\n\nIn the beta version offers for help are stored in a spreadsheet on paper. \n\nIndentifier\nContact\nAccount address \nHelp offer\nAmount of help (hours)\nBalance\nPrefered project\nDoesn’t have to be a real neame\nPrefered contact\nExample 0x29d6dad65336eB9E1D6D9162f07E50Ab23434b80\nTranslation from French. Proofread a paper\n \n3 hours\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the later version we can encrypt personal data and store the whole thing on IPFS.\n\nIdentifier\nContact\nAccount address \nHelp offer\nAmount of help (hours)\nBalance\nPrefered project\nDoesn’t have to be a real name\nContact is only seen by the prefered project key holder\nExample 0x29d6dad65336eB9E1D6D9162f07E50Ab23434b80\nTranslation from French\nProofread a paper\n \n3 hours\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the future versions a more complex web of trust system can be implemented to confirm entries before tokens are issued. However, this system doesn’t mean to be fully trustless at any stage. \n\nPaper wallets. Paper wallets are associated with guest token accounts. In a beta version the private key QR code is unencrypted, so it can be scanned at the bar. In the following versions paperwallets are replaced by a mobile UI, either non client wallets connecting to an ethereum node, or a proper mobile light client capable of supporting custom tokens.\n\nBar. In the beta and future versions the bar remains a bar with humans giving you beer. Nevertheless, we don’t discard a possibility to use IoT and implement a fully automated bar bot: beer dispenser and a cocktail machine with integrated Ethereum client and a bartender chat bot with face recognition. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to send gratitude to @fortyfoxes, who has been very supportive and helpful with setting the direction of our work. Additionally, vibrant Ethereum demographic, Dangerousbeans aka @donkeyscience, for encouraging us to write white paper, @gnidan for a useful feedback, and offer of help, @androlo for meaningful conversations about all that smart contract stuff when I had a little clue what it is all about,  EtherCamp team, and Room77. This list is growing.\n"

Beverage companies have developed multiple ways maximize value by connecting sponsored properties and consumers in nontraditional ways, and extending reach across multiple passion points. Beer consumption at events such as hackathons has demonstrated positive effect on team building and overall atmosphere. We propose to strengthen this dynamic by using a blockchain based token system which  seamlessly turns free beer into free software.\nWe show how blockchain paradigm combined with beer consumption at hackathons is dank and makes participants’ and beverage sponsors’ experience better: easy to start collaborations, more fun, potentially long term, and sponsorships more meaningful.\nWe discuss design and implementation of such system from social and technological perspective. Details about functional and tech specs are described in a separate document\n\n1. Introduction\n\nBeverage industry play an important role in software development and IT infrastructure, however in the area of decentralised technology, such as blockchain, it still remains in the shadows. We see names of companies in the area of finance, IoT, and since recently insurance and logistics associated with shiny blockchain projects, but not your favorite local brewery.\nPlatforms such as Github, make it easier to find and contribute to opensource projects one is excited about, however deprived of human interaction in meatspace. Hackathons sometimes spark longer collaborations, but the setting prioritise more outgoing people to quickly form teams. \nBeers, are consumed at hackathons, and by people who work on opensource projects. It is associated with having a good time and hanging out with people. \nTokens that can be redeemed for beer represent help that people offer to opensource projects. This representation is symbolic. And the transactions (redeeming tokens for beer at the bar) We explain why and how it is not a reward system in the section 1.2.\n\nBy design, the blockchain enforces transparency. Beverage companies would be able to show the number of transactions as their results of meaningful sponsorship. \nBlockchains offer a possibility to store the history without a need to maintain a poxy server.\n\n1.1. Driving Factors. There are three main goals of this project; make skill exchange easier and more fun, and remembered forever without any privacy breaches. Make sponsorship from beverage and other companies more meaningful and presentable. Make blockchains more dank. \nLarge beverage producers can afford sponsoring large events i.e football championships. Smaller local brewery will be able to support events in a cool way. Even when a small local unconference can create a long term collaborations in the future, it might pass unnoticed, at least for sponsors. \nWe aslo don’t really want some random corporates to push their APIs on us because of FOMA.\nOn top of that, we have to admit, that blockchains have created a lot of buzz, we might as well use this buzz to get better beer to small community events. \n\n1.2  Beer and blockchains to celebrate and remember collaboration, not as a poxy reward mechanism\n\nIt is important to note, that the system does not utilise beer as an incentive to contribute, because there is unlimited supply of beer in bars and supermarkets and because it is not the point at all and kills the magic.\n\nDedicating effort to opensource projects can’t and should not be measured in money, not even in beer, however, kudos can be symbolically represented by a transaction where tokens redeemed for beer in the case when a transaction is stored forever on the blockchain. Token thus transactions represent an offer to help open source projects which can’t be measured in either fiat or cryptographic currency.  Despite of beer being one of the first currencies (first known payslip - a clay tablet depicting the payment of beer to workers dating to between 3100BC and 3000BC, kept in the collection of the British Museum) we do not believe that rewarding people with beer is a viable system. This would open up for attacks in which beer drinking never finishes, rendering participants unable to move nor have a good time. Additionally, the return value of their contributions will be more like working for beer, not celebrating collaboration on the exciting opensource project because it is fun. Because it is important public infrastructure and commons that everyone will benefit from.

        "text": "BARDAPP: A SYSTEM THAT TURNS FREE BOOZE \nINTO FREE SOFTWARE, USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AND BEER.\n\n\n\n\nAbstract. Beverage companies have developed multiple ways maximize value by connecting sponsored properties and consumers in nontraditional ways, and extending reach across multiple passion points. Beer consumption at events such as hackathons has demonstrated positive effect on team building and overall atmosphere. We propose to strengthen this dynamic by using a blockchain based token system which  seamlessly turns free beer into free software.\nWe show how blockchain paradigm combined with beer consumption at hackathons is dank and makes participants’ and beverage sponsors’ experience better: easy to start collaborations, more fun, potentially long term, and sponsorships more meaningful.\nWe discuss design and implementation of such system from social and technological perspective. Details about functional and tech specs are described in a separate document\n\n1. Introduction\n\nBeverage industry play an important role in software development and IT infrastructure, however in the area of decentralised technology, such as blockchain, it still remains in the shadows. We see names of companies in the area of finance, IoT, and since recently insurance and logistics associated with shiny blockchain projects, but not your favorite local brewery.\nPlatforms such as Github, make it easier to find and contribute to opensource projects one is excited about, however deprived of human interaction in meatspace. Hackathons sometimes spark longer collaborations, but the setting prioritise more outgoing people to quickly form teams. \nBeers, are consumed at hackathons, and by people who work on opensource projects. It is associated with having a good time and hanging out with people. \nBarDapp is a token system. Tokens can be redeemed for beer represent help that people offer to opensource projects. This representation is symbolic. And the transactions (redeeming tokens for beer at the bar) We explain why and how it is not a reward system in the section 1.2.\n\nBy design, the blockchain enforces transparency. Beverage companies would be able to show the number of transactions as their results of meaningful sponsorship. \nBlockchains offer a possibility to store the history without a need to maintain a poxy server.\n\n1.1. Driving Factors. There are three main goals of this project; make skill exchange easier and more fun, and remembered forever without any privacy breaches. Make sponsorship from beverage and other companies more meaningful and presentable. Make blockchains more dank. \nLarge beverage producers can afford sponsoring large events i.e football championships. Smaller local brewery will be able to support events in a cool way. Even when a small local unconference can create a long term collaborations in the future, it might pass unnoticed, at least for sponsors. \nWe aslo don’t really want some random corporates to push their APIs on us because of FOMA.\nOn top of that, we have to admit, that blockchains have created a lot of buzz, we might as well use this buzz to get better beer to small community events. \n\n1.2  Beer and blockchains to celebrate and remember collaboration, not as a poxy reward mechanism\n\nIt is important to note, that the system does not utilise beer as an incentive to contribute, because there is unlimited supply of beer in bars and supermarkets and because it is not the point at all and kills the magic.\n\nDedicating effort to opensource projects can’t and should not be measured in money, not even in beer, however, kudos can be symbolically represented by a transaction where tokens redeemed for beer in the case when a transaction is stored forever on the blockchain. Token thus transactions represent an offer to help open source projects which can’t be measured in either fiat or cryptographic currency.  Despite of beer being one of the first currencies (first known payslip - a clay tablet depicting the payment of beer to workers dating to between 3100BC and 3000BC, kept in the collection of the British Museum) we do not believe that rewarding people with beer is a viable system. This would open up for attacks in which beer drinking never finishes, rendering participants unable to move nor have a good time. Additionally, the return value of their contributions will be more like working for beer, not celebrating collaboration on the exciting opensource project because it is fun. Because it is important public infrastructure and commons that everyone will benefit from. This should be celebrated and marked on the blockchain. \n\nTo summarise, our research shows, that this underlying protocol is dank enough to make sure that free as in beer is converted into free as in freedom in a secure way which preserves decency and fun. We demonstrate it through assembling IKEA furniture example. For example inviting your friends for a beer after they have helped you to assemble IKEA furniture, doesn’t mean that you are paying them in beer and they wouldn’t have done it for free. They have done it because they like you and want you to finally have furniture in you flat, that you, them and other friends can use in the future. Inviting your friends for a beer before you start assembling IKEA furniture doesn’t mean that your friends are in beer furniture assembling debt. \nBeer component in both cases is a symbolic transaction which represents the fact that it’s not really work and everyone is having a good time while achieving something. \n\n1.3. Beverage companies sponsorship. The Institute of Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen, the birthplace of quantum mechanics, was created in 1921 with significant funding from the Carlsberg Foundation. \nMonetary support from other types of sponsors interested in promoting their brand to a particular demographic is frequently spent on beer and snacks.\n\n\n2. Overview of Functional Specifications\n\n2.1 Comparison with other concepts\nIn a pledge fund, the investors provide a loose commitment of capital to an investment team, the manager of the fund, to make investments within certain preset parameters.\nTime-based currency is an alternative currency or exchange system where the unit of account/value is the person-hour or some other time unit. While there are some good things about time bank systems, they are often criticised for being useless and not so fun i.e swap one hour of dishwashing to one hour of dogwalking, maintain a ledger of it all. \nWe combine these two concepts with blockchains and beer which makes it more dank. \n\n2.2  Database. BarDapp participants offer to help an opensource project of their choice that is represented at an event i.e hackathon or a conference. Projects in question are interviewed prior to the event to create a list of needs. They are encouraged to communicate what help they might need apart from technical so that people with no or little programming skills can contribute to the project . These offers of help constitute a form of social capital pledge fund. Parameters of the pledge fund are that the offers of help can be only utilised for opensource projects that can do with some help.  \n\n2.3 What if people would lie?\nMost cryptographic ledger projects take in the consideration that people lie, therefore utilising trustlessness to settle transactions. \nWhat if someone will promise to help me with a project just to get a lot of free beer and never do anything? We have thought of this attack vector, and we will have to live with it. If someone wants to go through a hassle of getting a free beer by lying, well this particular pint won’t be turned into free software. To compensate for it we have to make sure that we have enough beer in the system.  \n\n3. Technical Specifications \nRoadmap for the Bar Decentralised Application starting with only a few functionalities in beta and minimum user interface, and a future creation of a full blown decentralised organisation. \nAt no stage this system is trustless nor fully automated or autonomous. Nor it is game-theoretical. At all stages human collaboration and drinking beer together remain at the core of this socio-technological system. Blockchain is used because it is transparent and will preserve transactions as a symbolic representation of people helping each others projects and drinking beer together.\nBeta version consists of three parts - a token system powered by EVM and Ethereum blockchain, a database of offers of help and a bar. In subsequent versions we introduce a more sophisticated database with a key management system. token system and a database will be linked in an automated, more trustless way. Bar will remain in a meatspace. We do not plan to implement a turing complete version of a bar, because of security reasons. \n\n3.2 Beta release components\n\nToken contract\nDatabase\nPaper wallets \nA bar\n\n\n3.3 Choice of beer for the protocol layer explained\nPrevious experiences show how beer is utilised to increase knowledge and skills pertaining to computer software, hardware and data networks. C-base - remnants of the ancient space station crashed in what is now known as Berlin several billion years ago, introduced a discount on beers and club mate that can be purchased in the bar for the members working on the reconstruction of a space station. Members of c-base use the location to work on personal and collaborative projects related to the reconstruction of the space station and meet at the bar to relax, chill and stay informed about each other’s projects. Beer at C-base space station can be also purchased in an automated beer dispenser while no one is at the bar, because it is important to maintain constant beer supply at all times.\n\nApart from promoting happiness and being associated with celebration, moderate consumption improves sleep. Sleep is very important, and often disregarded within a geeky demographic. 12oz of beer has about 150 calories, has no fat, no caffeine, and rich in vitamin B. \n\n\n3.3 How offers for help are stored?\n\nIn the beta version offers for help are stored in a spreadsheet on paper. \n\nIndentifier\nContact\nAccount address \nHelp offer\nAmount of help (hours)\nBalance\nPrefered project\nDoesn’t have to be a real neame\nPrefered contact\nExample 0x29d6dad65336eB9E1D6D9162f07E50Ab23434b80\nTranslation from French.

Beer tokens are exchanged for beers. reason to do all this stuff on the blockchain, and not just with beads or marbles, is that with a blockchain everyone will be able to see a symbolic history of these offers of help. A VERY important thing to say that it is not an incentive mechanism where someone pays people in beer in exchange of promises of help. Beer is rather symbolic thing there. People do help opensource projects already, but with the process we are suggesting it might be easier to discover new projects which can do with some help, and also for the projects to see that they have a lot of potential helpers and encourage them to publish not so ready code etc."
