In February 2008, several [[Creative Commons license]]s were \"approved for free cultural works\", namely the [[CC BY]] and [[CC BY-SA]] (later also the [[CC0]]).[https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8051 Approved for Free Cultural Works] Creative commons licenses with restrictions on commercial use or derivative works were not approved."

Therefore, the same three creative commons licenses are recommended for [[open content]] and free content, [[CC BY]], [[CC BY-SA]], and [[CC0]]. The Open Knowledge foundation defined additionally three specialized licenses for data and databases, previously unavailable, the ''Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and Licence'' (PDDL), the ''Open Data Commons Attribution License'' (ODC-BY) and the [[Open Data Commons Open Database License]] (ODbL)."
