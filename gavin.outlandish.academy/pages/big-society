      "text": "The Big Society was a political ideology developed in the early 21st century. The idea proposes \"integrating the free market with a theory of social solidarity based on hierarchy and voluntarism\". Conceptually it \"draws on a mix of conservative communitarianism and libertarian paternalism\". Its roots \"can be traced back to the 1990s, and to early attempts to develop a non-Thatcherite, or post-Thatcherite, brand of UK conservatism\" such as David Willets' Civic Conservatism and the revival of Red Toryism. Some commentators have seen the Big Society as invoking Edmund Burke's idea of civil society, putting it into the sphere of one-nation conservatism - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Society wikipedia]"

      "text": "The term \"Big Society' was originated by Steve Hilton, director of strategy for the Conservative Party, and the idea is particularly associated with the party's leader David Cameron who was a strong advocate for it. The idea became the flagship policy of the 2010 UK Conservative Party general election manifesto and formed part of the subsequent legislative programme of the Conservative â€“ Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement. The stated aim was to create a climate that empowered local people and communities, building a \"big society\" that would take power away from politicians and give it to people."

      "text": "In UK politics the Big Society concept applies to domestic policy in England only. The relevant policy areas are devolved in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and are therefore the responsibilities of respectively the Northern Ireland Executive, the Scottish Government and the Welsh Government in those countries."
