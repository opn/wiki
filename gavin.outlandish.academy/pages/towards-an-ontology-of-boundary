Nevertheless, I have been confronted by difficult epistemological issues. Am I talking about a hard boundary or a soft boundary? Epistemologically, a Boundary and its ‘hardness’, ‘softness’, ‘open-ness’ and ‘closed-ness’ are strongly influenced by the paradigms and worldviews, frameworks and contexts of the observer (Ulrich, 1983; Midgley, 2000). Star & Griesemer’s (1989) concept of Boundary Objects suggests that the Boundary concept itself is socially constructed and socially maintained, and therefore this must be regarded as an essential part of the ontology of Boundary."
