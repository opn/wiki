To fully exploit the potential of social technologies for collective intelligence and open innovation, leaders need to be boundary managers as well (Kotler, 2009; Fullan, 2001; Slawsby & Rivera, 2007), in order to motivate innovation by practising the effective management of boundary dynamics (Fagerberg, 2005; Lam, 2005; Kodama, 2010; Gharajedaghi, 2011)."
