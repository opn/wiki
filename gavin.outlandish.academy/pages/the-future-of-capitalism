By reducing the ‘marginal cost of reproduction’ to zero, the notion of ‘scarcity’ which is capitalism’s fundamental material, is exploded. And not only the scarcity of digital information, but increasingly the scarcity of physical goods as digital technologies offer the potential for radical reductions in manufacturing cost, waste and energy production. Another reason for the slowness in introduction of automation is that capital is nervous about reducing scarcity."
