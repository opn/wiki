Definition** – leadership is a creative, flexible, dynamic process with four dimensions:\n- a) *purpose and direction* – leadership inspires self and others to combine and work towards a clear, common, motivating aim;\n- b) *quality of process* – it addresses mindfulness of means, pace and quality of journey towards the shared aim, flexibly adapting to changing conditions, new insights, and fresh ideas;\n- c) *group unity* – it creates and upholds group unity, shared values and culture;\n- d) *individual effectiveness* – it remembers that although group unity is essential, each of us are individuals and thus respects and recognises our differences, ensuring engagement and personal growth, and evoking greater self-awareness, self-responsibility, and self-leadership.\n\n- **III. Shared Leadership** – leadership, being a process, is more than the individual leader, meaning that anyone in a group can contribute to leadership.  In fact, we must share leadership if we are to ensure wise, inclusive aims and full engagement, uphold democratic principles, and ultimately, wisely evolve.\n\n- **IV. Stakeholder Integration** – leadership decisions must consider the likely effects on all stakeholders, avoid false trade-offs that might lead to negative results, and always strive to benefit all stakeholders.\n\n- **V. Open, Balanced Synergy-Seeking** – leadership must be open to different perspectives, experience, skills and ideas, inside and outside our immediate environment, and create win-win solutions that balance long-term and short-term considerations not only for human life, but all life on this planet.  \n\n- **VI. Measure Everything That Matters** – leadership should ensure enduring positive impact in all forms of “capital” that help life to flourish, such as Economic, Environmental, Social, Experiential (physical and emotional), Intellectual, Cultural, Spiritual and Manufactured (built environment, technology, etc.).\n\n- **VII. Simplicity Beyond Complexity** – when creating solutions, even for complex problems, we should always consider this question: can we make this simpler and achieve the same (or better) outcome(s)?\n"

It could be formed as an independent arm of an existing educational organisation. This body’s strategic advisory board, the Global Leadership Standards Council, will be globally representative, majority non-executive, and voted in by open election. \n\n- This new educational body will collaborate with its partners to develop, implement, and support, a framework of practical coherent global standards for leadership education, training, practice, assessment, and continuing development. \n"

It could be formed as an independent arm of an existing educational organisation. This body’s strategic advisory board, the Global Leadership Standards Council, will be globally representative, majority non-executive, and voted in by open election. \n\n- This new educational body will collaborate with its partners to develop, implement, and support, a framework of practical coherent global standards for leadership education, training, practice, assessment, and continuing development. \n"

        "text": "- **I. Aim** – the purpose of leadership is to contribute to realizing a sustainable flourishing world.\n\n- **II. Definition** – leadership is a creative, flexible, dynamic process with four dimensions:\n- a) *purpose and direction* – leadership inspires self and others to combine and work towards a clear, common, motivating aim;\n- b) *quality of process* – it addresses mindfulness of means, pace and quality of journey towards the shared aim, flexibly adapting to changing conditions, new insights, and fresh ideas;\n- c) *group unity* – it creates and upholds group unity, shared values and culture;\n- d) *individual effectiveness* – it remembers that although group unity is essential, each of us are individuals and thus respects and recognises our differences, ensuring engagement and personal growth, and evoking greater self-awareness, self-responsibility, and self-leadership.\n\n- **III. Shared Leadership** – leadership, being a process, is more than the individual leader, meaning that anyone in a group can contribute to leadership.  In fact, we must share leadership if we are to ensure wise, inclusive aims and full engagement, uphold democratic principles, and ultimately, wisely evolve.\n\n- **IV. Stakeholder Integration** – leadership decisions must consider the likely effects on all stakeholders, avoid false trade-offs that might lead to negative results, and always strive to benefit all stakeholders.\n\n- **V. Open, Balanced Synergy-Seeking** – leadership must be open to different perspectives, experience, skills and ideas, inside and outside our immediate environment, and create win-win solutions that balance long-term and short-term considerations not only for human life, but all life on this planet.  \n\n- **VI. Measure Everything That Matters** – leadership should ensure enduring positive impact in all forms of “capital” that help life to flourish, such as Economic, Environmental, Social, Experiential (physical and emotional), Intellectual, Cultural, Spiritual and Manufactured (built environment, technology, etc.).\n\n- **VII. Simplicity Beyond Complexity** – when creating solutions, even for complex problems, we should always consider this question: can we make this simpler and achieve the same (or better) outcome(s)?\n"
