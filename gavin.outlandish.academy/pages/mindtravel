      "text": "Composer and pianist [https://www.mindtravel.com/about-murray/ Murray Hidary] began his journey exploring more traditional modes of musical expression, creating symphonies in Russia, working with string quintets in the U.S. and, of course, continuing his daily piano practice that started as a child. This practice grounded him through personal tribulations and during his tenure as an entrepreneur. It became a voice, a language he used to connect to his higher sense of purpose.  He called it *MindTravel*."

      "text": "In 2013, Hidary created his first MindTravel Live experience, playing music for an invited gathering of friends in his living room. The response was astounding.  Moved by the power of music to take the group on a deep inner journey, Hidary began to craft what would eventually become the MindTravel experience."

      "text": "Murray fused his vast experience in the visual arts, music with his insatiable hunger for understanding the mystery of life to create something truly unique. His provocative, improvisational, real-time compositions use piano and art projections, and are inspired by theoretical physics and wisdom traditions. At its core, MindTravel is an exploration of the notion that bringing the lessons of music into our daily lives can radically improve our focus and our ability to relax, and that with music as a teacher – we can peel back layers of our Self yet unseen."

Murray studied at New York University and scored the documentary REM about iconic architect Rem Koolhaas."

The stilled ‘movements’ are woven together into fluid and animated tapestries through algorithms designed to dynamically reflect the live music. The music and sounds intertwine effortlessly, with the intention of leading the audience to what lies beneath the surface."
