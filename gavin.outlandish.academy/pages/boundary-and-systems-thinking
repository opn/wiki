A general characteristic of an open system is that it is separated from its environment by a distinct boundary, but takes inputs from this environment and subjects them to a transformation process either to sustain itself or to create outputs (Angyal, 1941; Bertalanffy, 1968)."

The system has an ‘identity’ (name or form) associated with its boundary, and the latter keeps the unwanted out and the wanted in; allows inputs into the system that comply with the system’s overall function or needs, and lets out artefacts that need to be expelled from the system (transformed or not) (Kramer & de Smit, 1977)."

The boundary is ‘Janus-faced’, in that it faces out to the environment and in towards its core, both at the same time (Koestler, 1976); it is both ‘in’ and ‘out’, dual in nature, and conducting seemingly paradoxical functions in order to maintain the identity of the whole. In essence, the boundary could be seen as a boundary layer, rather than a simple line; the “gate keeper” of the system in focus; autonomous like a border control, but nevertheless deploying the rules set by the main system in order to maintain the identity of that system."

Extended to the collective, differing agendas and philosophies, power and politics will have a significant impact on the system (Ulrich, 1983; Midgley, 2000)."

        "text": "Although the characteristics of the boundary of a system illustrated in Figure 3 appear as if they apply to hard (‘real world’) systems thinking only, I believe they can be equally well applied to soft systems (individual or social constructions) (see Chapter 3 for my argument). A general characteristic of an open system is that it is separated from its environment by a distinct boundary, but takes inputs from this environment and subjects them to a transformation process either to sustain itself or to create outputs (Angyal, 1941; Bertalanffy, 1968)."

The boundary is ‘Janus-faced’, in that it faces out to the environment and in towards its core, both at the same time (Koestler, 1976); it is both ‘in’ and ‘out’, dual in nature, and conducting seemingly paradoxical functions in order to maintain the identity of the whole. In essence, the boundary could be seen as a boundary layer, rather than a simple line; the “gate keeper” of the system in focus; autonomous like a border control, but nevertheless deploying the rules set by the main system in order to maintain the identity of that system."

Extended to the collective, differing agendas and philosophies, power and politics will have a significant impact on the system (Ulrich, 1983; Midgley, 2000)."
