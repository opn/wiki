      "text": "Students for Free Culture, formerly known as FreeCulture.org, is an international student organization working to promote free culture ideals, such as cultural participation and access to information. It was inspired by the work of former Stanford, now Harvard, law professor Lawrence Lessig, who wrote the book Free Culture, and it frequently collaborates with other prominent free culture NGOs, including Creative Commons, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Public Knowledge.  Students for Free Culture has over 30 chapters on college campuses around the world, and a history of grassroots activism. - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_Free_Culture wikipedia]"
