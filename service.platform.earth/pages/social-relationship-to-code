Projects like [[Kubeless]] or the more basic [[DreamFactory]], and many other more corporate siblings, enable us to build a fedwiki server that speaks natively many languages."

It thrived because it brought together a community of software developers who also wanted to write. It was the combination of these two communities - writers that were interested in technology, and developers that wished to write that really brought value to the space. Wiki was the glue between these cultures."
