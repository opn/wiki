The existing programs from the GNU project were readily ported to run on the resultant platform. Most sources use the name ''[[Linux]]'' to refer to the general-purpose operating system thus formed, while Stallman and the FSF call it ''GNU/Linux''. This has been a longstanding naming controversy ([[GNU/Linux naming controversy]]) in the free software community. Stallman argues that not using GNU in the name of the operating system unfairly disparages the value of the GNU project and harms the sustainability of the free software movement by breaking the link between the software and the free software philosophy of the GNU project."
