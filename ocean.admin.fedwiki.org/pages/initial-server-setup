However, we may sometimes need to do administrative tasks.\n\nTo avoid having to log out of our normal user and log back in as the root account, we can set up what is known as \"super user\" or root privileges for our normal account. This will allow our normal user to run commands with administrative privileges by putting the word sudo before each command.\n\nTo add these privileges to our new user, we need to add the new user to the \"sudo\" group. By default, on Ubuntu 14.04, users who belong to the \"sudo\" group are allowed to use the sudo command.\n\nAs root, run this command to add your new user to the sudo group (substitute the highlighted word with your new user):\n\n    gpasswd -a demo sudo\n\nNow your user can run commands with super user privileges! For more information about how this works, check out this sudoers tutorial.\nStep Four — Add Public Key Authentication (Recommended)\n\nThe next step in securing your server is to set up public key authentication for your new user. Setting this up will increase the security of your server by requiring a private SSH key to log in.\nGenerate a Key Pair\n\nIf you do not already have an SSH key pair, which consists of a public and private key, you need to generate one. If you already have a key that you want to use, skip to the Copy the Public Key step.\n\nTo generate a new key pair, enter the following command at the terminal of your local machine (ie. your computer):\n\n    ssh-keygen\n\nAssuming your local user is called \"localuser\", you will see output that looks like the following:\n\nssh-keygen output\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/Users/localuser/.ssh/id_rsa):\n\nHit return to accept this file name and path (or enter a new name).\n\nNext, you will be prompted for a passphrase to secure the key with. You may either enter a passphrase or leave the passphrase blank.\n\nNote: If you leave the passphrase blank, you will be able to use the private key for authentication without entering a passphrase. If you enter a passphrase, you will need both the private key and the passphrase to log in. Securing your keys with passphrases is more secure, but both methods have their uses and are more secure than basic password authentication.\n\nThis generates a private key, id_rsa, and a public key, id_rsa.pub, in the .ssh directory of the localuser's home directory. Remember that the private key should not be shared with anyone who should not have access to your servers!\nCopy the Public Key\n\nAfter generating an SSH key pair, you will want to copy your public key to your new server. We will cover two easy ways to do this.\nOption 1: Use ssh-copy-id\n\nIf your local machine has the ssh-copy-id script installed, you can use it to install your public key to any user that you have login credentials for.\n\nRun the ssh-copy-id script by specifying the user and IP address of the server that you want to install the key on, like this:\n\n    ssh-copy-id demo@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS\n\nAfter providing your password at the prompt, your public key will be added to the remote user's .ssh/authorized_keys file. The corresponding private key can now be used to log into the server."

For more information about how this works, check out this sudoers tutorial.\nStep Four — Add Public Key Authentication (Recommended)\n\nThe next step in securing your server is to set up public key authentication for your new user. Setting this up will increase the security of your server by requiring a private SSH key to log in.\nGenerate a Key Pair\n\nIf you do not already have an SSH key pair, which consists of a public and private key, you need to generate one. If you already have a key that you want to use, skip to the Copy the Public Key step.\n\nTo generate a new key pair, enter the following command at the terminal of your local machine (ie. your computer):\n\n    ssh-keygen\n\nAssuming your local user is called \"localuser\", you will see output that looks like the following:\n\nssh-keygen output\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/Users/localuser/.ssh/id_rsa):\n\nHit return to accept this file name and path (or enter a new name).\n\nNext, you will be prompted for a passphrase to secure the key with. You may either enter a passphrase or leave the passphrase blank.\n\nNote: If you leave the passphrase blank, you will be able to use the private key for authentication without entering a passphrase. If you enter a passphrase, you will need both the private key and the passphrase to log in. Securing your keys with passphrases is more secure, but both methods have their uses and are more secure than basic password authentication.\n\nThis generates a private key, id_rsa, and a public key, id_rsa.pub, in the .ssh directory of the localuser's home directory. Remember that the private key should not be shared with anyone who should not have access to your servers!\nCopy the Public Key\n\nAfter generating an SSH key pair, you will want to copy your public key to your new server. We will cover two easy ways to do this.\nOption 1: Use ssh-copy-id\n\nIf your local machine has the ssh-copy-id script installed, you can use it to install your public key to any user that you have login credentials for.\n\nRun the ssh-copy-id script by specifying the user and IP address of the server that you want to install the key on, like this:\n\n    ssh-copy-id demo@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS\n\nAfter providing your password at the prompt, your public key will be added to the remote user's .ssh/authorized_keys file. The corresponding private key can now be used to log into the server."
