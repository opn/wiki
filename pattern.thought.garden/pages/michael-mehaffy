Together with [[Ward Cunningham]], the inventor of [[wiki]], he wrote a paper arguing for the importance of wiki as a \"curated\" process of acquiring and improving knowledge, while explaining its relationship to [[pattern language]] methodology.[ Proceedings of the 20th Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs, October 23–26, 2013, Monticello, Illinois] He has also worked extensively with [[Christopher Alexander]] and [[Nikos Salingaros]] to jointly develop new concepts of \"generative codes\" and urban self-organization. In the book ''Design for a Living Planet'', Mehaffy introduced \"Place Network Theory,\" which he described as a \"grand unified theory of urbanism\" synthesizing the ideas of [[Christopher Alexander]], [[Jane Jacobs]], Kevin Lynch ([[Kevin A. Lynch]]), [[Alfred North Whitehead]], [[Rene Thom]], [[Bruno Latour]] and others. In philosophy, Mehaffy has argued for a \"neo-structuralism\" to inform architecture and urbanism, and to resolve key problems in philosophy and linguistics. Mehaffy argued that abstractions should be treated as structures like any other, but that they are distinctive only in the symmetric relationships that humans exploit to gain relevant information about parts of the world that are of interest—what he termed a \"symmetric structuralism\"."
