The seminal work of [[Arthur Prior]] applied the same formal language to treat [[temporal logic]] and paved the way for the marriage of the two subjects. [[Saul Kripke]] discovered (contemporaneously with rivals) his theory of frame semantics ([[Kripke semantics]]), which revolutionized the formal technology available to modal logicians and gave a new graph-theoretic ([[graph theory]]) way of looking at modality that has driven many applications in [[computational linguistics]] and [[computer science]], such as dynamic logic ([[dynamic logic (modal logic)]])."

Dialectic has been linked to logic since ancient times, but it has not been until recent decades that European and American logicians have attempted to provide mathematical foundations for logic and dialectic by formalising dialectical logic. [[Dialectical logic]] is also the name given to the special treatment of dialectic in [[Hegel]]ian and [[Marx]]ist thought.  There have been pre-formal treatises on argument and dialectic, from authors such as [[Stephen Toulmin]] (''The Uses of Argument''), [[Nicholas Rescher]] (''Dialectics''),[http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/article/view/2809 Dialectics: A Controversy-Oriented Approach to the Theory of Knowledge][https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/25075-philosophical-dialectics-an-essay-on-metaphilosophy/ Nicholas Rescher: Philosophical Dialectics][https://books.google.com/books?id=T65moyMMioYC Reason, Method, and Value: A Reader on the Philosophy of Nicholas Rescher] and van Eemeren and Grootendorst ([[Pragma-dialectics]]).  Theories of [[defeasible reasoning]] can provide a foundation for the formalisation of dialectical logic and dialectic itself can be formalised as moves in a game, where an advocate for the truth of a proposition and an opponent argue.  Such games can provide a formal [[game semantics]] for many logics."

The seminal work of [[Arthur Prior]] applied the same formal language to treat [[temporal logic]] and paved the way for the marriage of the two subjects. [[Saul Kripke]] discovered (contemporaneously with rivals) his theory of frame semantics ([[Kripke semantics]]), which revolutionized the formal technology available to modal logicians and gave a new graph-theoretic ([[graph theory]]) way of looking at modality that has driven many applications in [[computational linguistics]] and [[computer science]], such as dynamic logic ([[dynamic logic (modal logic)]])."
