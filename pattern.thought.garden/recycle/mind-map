It is often created around a single concept, drawn as an image in the center of a blank page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, words and parts of words are added. Major ideas are connected directly to the central concept, and other ideas branch out from those - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map wikipedia]"

A meta study about [[concept map]]ping concluded that concept mapping is more effective than \"reading text passages, attending lectures, and participating in class discussions\".[ ] The same study also concluded that concept mapping is slightly more effective \"than other constructive activities such as writing summaries and outlines\". In addition, they concluded that low-ability students may benefit more from mind mapping than high-ability students."

It is often created around a single concept, drawn as an image in the center of a blank page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, words and parts of words are added. Major ideas are connected directly to the central concept, and other ideas branch out from those - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map wikipedia]"

However, there were exceptions. "
