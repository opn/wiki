        "text": "Satire is used on many UK television programmes, particularly popular panel shows and quiz shows such as ''[[Mock the Week]]'' (2005) and ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' (1990–ongoing). Similarly it is found on radio quiz shows such as ''[[The News Quiz]]'' (1977–ongoing) and ''[[The Now Show]]'' (1998–ongoing). One of the most-watched UK television shows of the 1980s and early 1990s, the puppet show ''[[Spitting Image]]'' was a satire of the royal family ([[British Royal Family]]), politics, entertainment, sport and [[British culture]] of the era. Created by DMA Design ([[Rockstar North]]) in 1997, satire also features prominently in the British video game series ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]''.[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/10316267/GTA-5-a-Great-British-export.html GTA 5: a Great British export]"

Colbert's character ([[Stephen Colbert (character)]]) is an opinionated and self-righteous commentator who, in his TV interviews, interrupts people, points and wags his finger at them, and \"unwittingly\" uses a number of logical fallacies. In doing so, he demonstrates the principle of modern American political satire: the ridicule of the actions of politicians and other public figures by taking all their statements and purported beliefs to their furthest (supposedly) logical conclusion, thus revealing their perceived hypocrisy or absurdity."

        "text": "In Canada, satire has become an important part of the comedy scene. [[Stephen Leacock]] was one of the best known early Canadian satirists, and in the early 20th century, he achieved fame by targeting the attitudes of small town life. In more recent years, Canada has had several prominent satirical television series and radio shows. Some, including ''[[CODCO]]'', ''[[The Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'', ''[[This Is That]]'', and ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' deal directly with current news stories and political figures, while others, like ''[[History Bites]]'' present contemporary social satire in the context of events and figures in history. The Canadian organization ''[[Canada News Network]]'' provides commentary on contemporary news events that are primarily Canadian in nature. Canadian songwriter Nancy White ([[Nancy White (singer-songwriter)]]) uses music as the vehicle for her satire, and her comic folk songs are regularly played on CBC Radio ([[CBC Radio One]])."

        "text": "Cartoonists often use satire as well as straight humour. [[Al Capp]]'s satirical [[comic strip]] ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' was censored in September 1947. The controversy, as reported in ''Time'', centred on Capp's portrayal of the US Senate. Said Edward Leech of Scripps-Howard, \"We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables.\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804275,00.html Tain't Funny – ''Time''] [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''Pogo ([[Pogo (comics)]])'' was likewise censored in 1952 over his overt satire of Senator Joe McCarthy ([[Joseph McCarthy]]), caricatured in his comic strip as \"Simple J. Malarky\".  [[Garry Trudeau]], whose [[comic strip]] ''[[Doonesbury]]'' focuses on satire of the political system, and provides a trademark cynical view on national events. Trudeau exemplifies humour mixed with criticism. For example, the character [[Mark Slackmeyer]] lamented that because he was not legally married to his partner, he was deprived of the \"exquisite agony\" of experiencing a nasty and painful divorce like heterosexuals. This, of course, satirized the claim that gay unions would denigrate the sanctity of heterosexual marriage."

As well as the purely humorous effect of this sort of thing, they often strongly criticise various phenomena in politics, economic life, religion and many other aspects of society, and thus qualify as satirical. Due to their animated nature, these shows can easily use images of public figures and generally have greater freedom to do so than conventional shows using live actors."

Or someone else can say, 'Cancer’s ''hilarious'', but don’t talk about rape because my cousin got raped.' Those are rather extreme examples, but if it affects somebody personally, they tend to be more sensitive about it.\""

[[Stephen Leacock]] was one of the best known early Canadian satirists, and in the early 20th century, he achieved fame by targeting the attitudes of small town life. In more recent years, Canada has had several prominent satirical television series and radio shows. Some, including ''[[CODCO]]'', ''[[The Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'', ''[[This Is That]]'', and ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' deal directly with current news stories and political figures, while others, like ''[[History Bites]]'' present contemporary social satire in the context of events and figures in history. The Canadian organization ''[[Canada News Network]]'' provides commentary on contemporary news events that are primarily Canadian in nature. Canadian songwriter Nancy White ([[Nancy White (singer-songwriter)]]) uses music as the vehicle for her satire, and her comic folk songs are regularly played on CBC Radio ([[CBC Radio One]])."

Said Edward Leech of Scripps-Howard, \"We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables.\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804275,00.html Tain't Funny – ''Time''] [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''Pogo ([[Pogo (comics)]])'' was likewise censored in 1952 over his overt satire of Senator Joe McCarthy ([[Joseph McCarthy]]), caricatured in his comic strip as \"Simple J. Malarky\".  [[Garry Trudeau]], whose [[comic strip]] ''[[Doonesbury]]'' focuses on satire of the political system, and provides a trademark cynical view on national events. Trudeau exemplifies humour mixed with criticism. For example, the character [[Mark Slackmeyer]] lamented that because he was not legally married to his partner, he was deprived of the \"exquisite agony\" of experiencing a nasty and painful divorce like heterosexuals. This, of course, satirized the claim that gay unions would denigrate the sanctity of heterosexual marriage."

As well as the purely humorous effect of this sort of thing, they often strongly criticise various phenomena in politics, economic life, religion and many other aspects of society, and thus qualify as satirical. Due to their animated nature, these shows can easily use images of public figures and generally have greater freedom to do so than conventional shows using live actors."
