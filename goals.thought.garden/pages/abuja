It is a planned city and was built mainly in the 1980s, replacing the country's most populous city of Lagos as the capital on 12 December 1991.

The Presidential Complex, National Assembly, Supreme Court and much of the city extend to the south of the rock.

As of 2015, the city is experiencing an annual growth of at least 35%, retaining its position as the fastest-growing city on the African continent and one of the fastest-growing in the world. Abuja has witnessed a huge influx of people into the city; the growth has led to the emergence of satellite towns, such as Karu Urban Area, Suleja, Gwagwalada, Lugbe, Kuje and smaller settlements towards which the planned city is sprawling. The unofficial metropolitan area of Abuja has a population of over three million, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Nigeria, surpassed by Lagos, Kano and Ibadan. As at 2016, the metropolitan area of Abuja is estimated at six million persons, placing it behind Lagos, as the most populous metro area. The city has a large and growing immigrant community comprising mainly of nationals from the ECOWAS sub-region. The city has been undergoing a rapid pace of physical development over the last fifteen years."
