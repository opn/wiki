He lived there from June 1, 1925 1 until his death on April 16 , 1930 , along with his wife and four children.\n\nThe house is an old site built in the early years of the last century in what were the extrawalls of Lima in the early twenties, a city that sought to open up to modernity and urban development. Of a single floor, this construction kept the basic architectural characteristics of its time.\n\nAfter the death of José Carlos Mariátegui the place was left by his wife and children, and was occupied by different people. However, a few years after the disappearance of the Amauta, voices were heard that insisted on the need to create in it a space that would serve to disseminate the work of the distinguished thinker.\n\nAfter years of claims and warnings made by the most renowned intellectuals of the last century, the house in which José Carlos Mariátegui lived was saved from demolition in 1972 by the National Institute of Culture of Peru, which declared it a Republican Historical Monument. This was only the first step, since given in rent for some time back by the owners of then, the tugurizada edificación still ran the danger of getting lost.\n\nIn the second government of the architect Fernando Belaúnde Terry its incorporation as public patrimony was obtained, receiving their owners a ground in exchange. However, the desired recovery was not achieved. Nor could the Mayor of Lima, Don Alfonso Barrantes Lingán, in the course of his administration, because of his disagreements with the government of that time, which had to provide him with the necessary resources.\n\nDuring the dictatorial government of Alberto Fujimori , and before the repeated pressures of the Peruvian and foreign intelligentsia, the recovery of the house began with the retirement of its tenants precarious. It was delivered in the commemorative week of the Centenary of the Birth of José Carlos Mariátegui , which was celebrated in all corners of the country and in most of the nations of America and Europe. The president sought to improve his image with the international community. It was inaugurated on June 17, 1994.\n\nFrom December 1995, he moved from the Ministry of Education to the National Institute of Culture, opening its doors to host various academic and cultural entities linked to the thinking of the Amauta or other similar activities.\n\nCurrently, and under the responsibility of the Ministry of Culture, the museum develops exhibitions and conferences. In addition, the public has free access to the Library, where there are numerous works of the 'Amauta' and other authors, books of Peruvian reality, magazines, etc. The entrance to their facilities is completely free.\n\nOn February 15, 2018 a new permanent exhibition was inaugurated where, for the first time, informative materials about the life and work of Mariátegui are presented.\n\n# Censorship \nCasa Mariátegui, being a space dedicated to the memory of a thinker with social sensitivity and a clear Marxist line like Mariátegui, has not been exempt from problems that contradict his work as an institution that provides a public service with the interests of state management and the governments of the day.\n\nIn 1999, in the Fujimorist government, the complete exhibition of the visual artist Félix Álvarez was censored and canceled a few hours after the inauguration at the express request of the director of the National Institute of Culture, it seems that these orders came from higher instances. 2 Within a few weeks the Casa Mariategui computer was mysteriously stolen from the institution. Both facts were not mentioned by the press categorically (much of this handled by Fujimorismo) and there was no major scandal.\n\nThe second censorship suffered generated even more controversy occurred in 2007. The exhibition \"Drawings in the press 1990-2007\" by the artist Piero Quijano, planned to open on Thursday, June 21, 2007, was intended to be partially censored. According to it is said, from an office sent by the general commander of the Army, Edwin Donaire to the National Institute of Culture. The trigger for this reaction was a drawing that, referring to the monument to the US soldiers in Okinawa, in World War II, shows a group of Peruvian soldiers raising a rifle against the head of an Andean peasant. 3 President Alan García himself defended the said arguing that he had \"insulted\" the Armed Forces. with drawings alluding to military crimes. 4 This censorship led to the then director, Armando Williams, resigning his position and the artist decided to withdraw his sample completely. The exhibition was reopened at Espacio La Culpable 5 a few days later."

      "text": "# History\nIn this building José Carlos Mariátegui made his most fruitful work and for which he is recognized worldwide. He lived there from June 1, 1925 1 until his death on April 16 , 1930 , along with his wife and four children.\n\nThe house is an old site built in the early years of the last century in what were the extrawalls of Lima in the early twenties, a city that sought to open up to modernity and urban development. Of a single floor, this construction kept the basic architectural characteristics of its time.\n\nAfter the death of José Carlos Mariátegui the place was left by his wife and children, and was occupied by different people. However, a few years after the disappearance of the Amauta, voices were heard that insisted on the need to create in it a space that would serve to disseminate the work of the distinguished thinker.\n\nAfter years of claims and warnings made by the most renowned intellectuals of the last century, the house in which José Carlos Mariátegui lived was saved from demolition in 1972 by the National Institute of Culture of Peru, which declared it a Republican Historical Monument. This was only the first step, since given in rent for some time back by the owners of then, the tugurizada edificación still ran the danger of getting lost.\n\nIn the second government of the architect Fernando Belaúnde Terry its incorporation as public patrimony was obtained, receiving their owners a ground in exchange. However, the desired recovery was not achieved. Nor could the Mayor of Lima, Don Alfonso Barrantes Lingán, in the course of his administration, because of his disagreements with the government of that time, which had to provide him with the necessary resources.\n\nDuring the dictatorial government of Alberto Fujimori , and before the repeated pressures of the Peruvian and foreign intelligentsia, the recovery of the house began with the retirement of its tenants precarious. It was delivered in the commemorative week of the Centenary of the Birth of José Carlos Mariátegui , which was celebrated in all corners of the country and in most of the nations of America and Europe. The president sought to improve his image with the international community. It was inaugurated on June 17, 1994.\n\nFrom December 1995, he moved from the Ministry of Education to the National Institute of Culture, opening its doors to host various academic and cultural entities linked to the thinking of the Amauta or other similar activities.\n\nCurrently, and under the responsibility of the Ministry of Culture, the museum develops exhibitions and conferences. In addition, the public has free access to the Library, where there are numerous works of the 'Amauta' and other authors, books of Peruvian reality, magazines, etc. The entrance to their facilities is completely free.\n\nOn February 15, 2018 a new permanent exhibition was inaugurated where, for the first time, informative materials about the life and work of Mariátegui are presented.\n\n# Censorship \nCasa Mariátegui, being a space dedicated to the memory of a thinker with social sensitivity and a clear Marxist line like Mariátegui, has not been exempt from problems that contradict his work as an institution that provides a public service with the interests of state management and the governments of the day.\n\nIn 1999, in the Fujimorist government, the complete exhibition of the visual artist Félix Álvarez was censored and canceled a few hours after the inauguration at the express request of the director of the National Institute of Culture, it seems that these orders came from higher instances. 2 Within a few weeks the Casa Mariategui computer was mysteriously stolen from the institution. Both facts were not mentioned by the press categorically (much of this handled by Fujimorismo) and there was no major scandal.\n\nThe second censorship suffered generated even more controversy occurred in 2007. The exhibition \"Drawings in the press 1990-2007\" by the artist Piero Quijano, planned to open on Thursday, June 21, 2007, was intended to be partially censored. According to it is said, from an office sent by the general commander of the Army, Edwin Donaire to the National Institute of Culture. The trigger for this reaction was a drawing that, referring to the monument to the US soldiers in Okinawa, in World War II, shows a group of Peruvian soldiers raising a rifle against the head of an Andean peasant. 3 President Alan García himself defended the said arguing that he had \"insulted\" the Armed Forces. with drawings alluding to military crimes. 4 This censorship led to the then director, Armando Williams, resigning his position and the artist decided to withdraw his sample completely. The exhibition was reopened at Espacio La Culpable 5 a few days later."
