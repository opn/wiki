Are there action cards that were difficult to complete? Should we focus on some action cards that we have undersued so far? Where are the gaps? Can we see the start of a beautifully documented story? Is the pollination aspect looking promising in terms of potential conversations it could trigger?\"*. Once the time has elapsed, each player goes back to its role (let us not change role yet, let us first play and explore and push the possibilities of each one's role a bit more :-)\n- Second round: 33'33s during which each players produces a maximum of *Traces*.\n- Second 6'66s break: same as first break, except that a the end of the break, the players who wish to change role can out back their Role card and its related Action cards in the stack of cards, and randomly receive a new Role card. Players who want to stick with their first Role can do so.\n- Third round: same, but lasts 44'44s.\nAnd so on, til the event ends up. At the end of the event, players can gather and have a look at the result of their collaboratively crafted Story, and help catalyze the dissemination of it through the relevant conversational channels identified by the Pollinator."

There are usually 2 scribes for each game.\n            \n- **The Iconographer** : it is the person who is in charge to illustrate the event.

He/she have to find articles, conversations, forum about the topic about and try to find and complete the writing by good sources, and if there is a polemic,  try to find what is about)\n            \n- **The Pollinator** : this role have 2 (or 3)task : \n                -finds conversational spaces (forums, chats, specific #hashtags,...) where the topic is actively  discussed by a bunch of people\n                -does a mapping of those conversatinal spaces (Note: *there is a useful resource at newspeak house, which is a list of all tech or political groups related to their topic democracy+technology+art*\n\n                -posts comments or tweets on the go, every hour or so, with a link to the Story that is being crafted -even though it is not complete-, making sure that it is actually relating to the interests of the people of the particular conversational space. He can then invite them to join the production by sending them one of the remaining Role cards, or simply the final result of the Story\n                -follows-up with the posts he made during the week that follows the event, to keep the conversation on and help it grow.  \n    \n- **The Summarian** (Animator): \n     -collects all the contents and makes them coherent with each others, especially by summarizing them \n(be it through drawings, text or audio format) and by proposing an esthetics to put them altogether. \n  \n- **The Audio Poet**: \n    -runs 2' interviews with the participants of the event to fuel the Story with different voices and viewpoints\n    -*Sina to invent and propose playful easy to make audio formats* \n \n- **The Newage Mapper**:\n    -proposes insightful visualizations (be them digital datavisualization or handmade drawings) to give the future readers of the Story a sense of the atmosphere, spirit and mood of the event\n\n- **The 5Sense Translator**: translates all the contents into a sign language fashion."
