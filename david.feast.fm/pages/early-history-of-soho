Houses became divided into tenements with chronic overcrowding and disease. A serious outbreak of [[cholera]] in 1854 around Soho caused the remaining upper-class families to leave the area. A considerable number of hospitals were built to cope with the health problem, with six being constructed between 1851 and 1874."
