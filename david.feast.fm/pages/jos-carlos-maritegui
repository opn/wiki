The fascist offensive is explained, and is realised in Italy, as a consequence of a retreat or a defeat of the revolution.\n\n- I am self-taught. I once registered in Arts in Lima, but only in the interest of taking an erudite Augustine’s Latin course. And, in Europe I freely attended some courses, but without ever deciding to lose my extra-collegiate, and perhaps anti-collegiate, status.\n\n- Peru is a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country at the same time. Though this may seem as a paradox, this is a fact and has to be changed.\n\n- The fight is long and tough, but together we can make it."
