We look to attract a select group of writers and researchers to weave these conversations together. These conversations could happen at home and online, or at existing events, or new ones we organise. At the same time we use each event as a milestone to test out actual new \"federated\" software integrations.\n\nAs part of these conversations we would explore the larger topics and ambitions of games, and modelling, and the representation of argument as a new form of evolutionary language. In so doing we would build both a community, and a code base leading up to a Kickstarter.\n\nThe emphasis here is on the quality and innovative nature of the content and it;s presentation. It needs to be clearly different in look and feel from existing content, in that it is decentralised and perceived as part of a process of building - that is as part of an agile development strategy. \n\nAt the same time the nature and feel of the events and conversations needs to be different, the way the conversations and arguments are convened, and represented. I see the work of [[Bret Victor]] and [[Bruno Latour]] and [[E O Wilson]] as relevant here."

        "text": "My proposal essentially would that we would undertake to convene a series of discussions, which we record and write in Fedwiki. We look to attract a select group of writers and researchers to weave these conversations together. These conversations could happen at home and online, or at existing events, or new ones we organise. At the same time we use each event as a milestone to test out actual new \"federated\" software integrations.\n\nAs part of these conversations we would explore the larger topics and ambitions of games, and modelling, and the representation of argument as a new form of evolutionary language. In so doing we would build both a community, and a code base leading up to a Kickstarter.\n\nThe emphasis here is on the quality and innovative nature of the content and it;s presentation. It needs to be clearly different in look and feel from existing content, in that it is decentralised and perceived as part of a process of building - that is as part of an agile development strategy. \n\nAt the same time the nature and feel of the events and conversations needs to be different, the way the conversations and arguments are convened, and represented. I see the work of [[Bret Victor]] and [[Bruno Latour]] and [[E O Wilson]] as relevant here."
