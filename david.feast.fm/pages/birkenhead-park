A Private Act of Parliament ([[Local and Personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom]]) allowed it to use public money to buy 226 of marshy grazing land on the western edge of Birkenhead. Plots of land on the edge of the proposed park were then sold off in order to finance its construction. Although some large houses and private villas were initially built by local merchants and wealthier business people, the [[Long Depression]] in the latter 19th century would mean that many plots remained undeveloped well into early 20th century."

        "text": "The Improvement Commission chose Paxton to design the park and [[Edward Kemp]] as the works supervisor because both had previously worked on redesigning the gardens at [[Chatsworth House]]. The park, which took five years to build, was designed to be natural and informal rather than a structured neatly arranged urban garden. Several miles of drainage pipes were lain to remove the water from the marshy land. The park also led to the diversion of Old Bidston Road and the loss of a direct route between Claughton ([[Claughton, Merseyside]]) and Woodside ([[Woodside, Merseyside]]). During construction, hundreds of tonnes of stone and earth was moved to create well-drained terraces, hills, rockeries and lakes. Paxton planted numerous trees and shrubs at various places so visitors would enjoy the surprise of unexpected views or hidden features as they wandered through the park. Buildings included the Swiss Bridge, Boathouse, Norman Lodges, Gothic Lodge, Castellated Lodge and Italian Lodge. The Grand Entrance ([[Grand Entrance to Birkenhead Park]]), which is one of several into the park, was built to look like a classical [[triumphal arch]]. As many as 10,000 people attended the official opening in 1847."

      "text": "The Improvement Commission chose Paxton to design the park and [[Edward Kemp]] as the works supervisor because both had previously worked on redesigning the gardens at [[Chatsworth House]]. The park, which took five years to build, was designed to be natural and informal rather than a structured neatly arranged urban garden. Several miles of drainage pipes were lain to remove the water from the marshy land. The park also led to the diversion of Old Bidston Road and the loss of a direct route between Claughton ([[Claughton, Merseyside]]) and Woodside ([[Woodside, Merseyside]]). During construction, hundreds of tonnes of stone and earth was moved to create well-drained terraces, hills, rockeries and lakes. Paxton planted numerous trees and shrubs at various places so visitors would enjoy the surprise of unexpected views or hidden features as they wandered through the park. Buildings included the Swiss Bridge, Boathouse, Norman Lodges, Gothic Lodge, Castellated Lodge and Italian Lodge. The Grand Entrance ([[Grand Entrance to Birkenhead Park]]), which is one of several into the park, was built to look like a classical [[triumphal arch]]. As many as 10,000 people attended the official opening in 1847."
