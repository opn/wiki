But they are also influenced by the other instruments of the region such as the beautiful West African harp, the kora, and the balafon. Entertainment is the role of certain casts. The performance of music is the realm of specialized casts. The Griots or ''Awlube'' recite the history of the people, places and events of the community."

Most Fula in the countryside spend long times alone on foot,  and can be seen frequently parading with their cattle throughout the west African [[hinterland]], moving their herds in search of water and better pasture. They were, and still are, the only major migratory people group of West Africa, although the [[Tuareg people]], another nomadic tribe of North African origin, live just immediately north of Fula territory, and sometimes live alongside the Fulani in countries such as Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. The Fulani, as a result of their constant wandering of the past, can be seen in every climatic zone and habitat of West Africa, from the deserts of the north, to the derived [[savannah]] and forests of the south - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fula_people#Herding wikipedia]"

These are the highest elevated places in West Africa, and their altitude can reach up to 8,700 feet above sea level. The highland plateaus have a more temperate climate conducive for cattle herding activities, which allowed Fulbe populations to settle there in waves of migrations from further west. Though most Fula now live in towns or villages, a large proportion of the population is still either fully nomadic, or semi-nomadic in nature."

Being the most treasured animal that the Fulanis herd, the cows are very special. Many people say that a person cannot speak Fulfulde if he does not own a cow. The Fulani have a tradition of giving a ''habbanaya'' -  a cow which is loaned to another until she calves. Once the calf is weaned it is retained and the cow is returned to its owner. This habbanaya is a highly prized animal. Upon receipt of this gift, there is a special ceremony in honor of the gift. The recipient buys special treats and invites his neighbors for this event in which the habbanaya is given a name. The habbanaya is never to be struck under any circumstance."

The widely accepted theory for the origin of present-day zebu cattle in West Africa is that they came from the westward spread of the early zebu populations in East Africa through the Sudan. Other breeds of zebu are found mainly in the drier regions. Their body conformation resembles the zebu cattle of eastern Africa. The zebu did not appear in West Africa until about 1800.[http://dagris.ilri.cgiar.org/display.asp?ID=77 DAGRIS] The increasing aridity of the climate and the deterioration of the environment in the Sahel appear to have favoured the introduction and spread of the zebu, as they are superior to longhorn and shorthorn [[cattle]] in withstanding drought conditions."

The subsequent successive introductions of the short-horned zebu are believed to have displaced most [[sanga cattle]] into southern Africa."

In the wetter areas of Fouta Djallon and Casamance, the dwarf [[N'Dama]] is more common, as they are highly resistant to trypanosomiasis ([[Animal trypanosomiasis]]) and other conditions directly associated with high humidity. Subspecies of zebu include the [[White Fulani cattle]], locally known as the Aku, Akuji, Bororoji, White Kano, Yakanaji or Bunaji, which are an important beef breed of cattle found throughout the area conquered by the Fulani people and beyond in the Sahel zone of Africa."

      "text": "''Kossam'' can be the general term for both fresh milk miradam and yoghurt known as ''pendidan'' in Fulfulde. It is central to Fulbe identity and revered as a drink or in one of its various processed forms, such as yoghurt and cheese. ''Kettugol'' and ''lébol'' are derived from milk fat,  are used in light cooking and hair weaving. It is common to see Fulani women hawking milk products in characteristic beautifully decorated calabashes balanced on their heads. Other meals include a heavy grease ''(nyiiri)''  made of flour from such grains as millet, sorghum, or corn which is eaten in combination with soup (''takai'', ''haako'') made from tomatoes, onions, spices, peppers, and other vegetables.[http://www.everyculture.com/wc/Germany-to-Jamaica/Fulani.html Fulani - Introduction, Location, Language, Folklore, Religion, Major holidays, Rites of passage, Relationships, Living conditions] - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fula_people#Food wikipedia]"

      "text": "Another popular meal eaten by almost all Fulani communities is made from fermenting milk into yoghurt and eaten with corn [[couscous]] known as ''latchiiri'' or ''dakkere'', either in the same bowl or separately, also a fluid or porridge called ''gāri'' made of flour cereals such as millet, sorghum or corn and milk. The [[Wodaabe]] traditionally eat millet, milk and meat as staples. Millet is eaten in the morning, noon and night as a grease with a sauce or stew which usually contains tomatoes, peppers, bone, meat, onion, and other vegetables. On special occasions they eat meat such as goat or beef. A thick beverage similar to the Tuareg ''eghajira'' is made by pounding goat cheese, milk, dates and millet."
