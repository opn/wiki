He turned away from the hermetic esthetic principles of post-symbolism and cultivated the dynamic openness of [[social realism]]. Like such French æsthetes as Verlaine, Machado began with a [[fin de siècle]] contemplation of his sensory world, portraying it through memory and the impressions of his private consciousness. And like his socially conscious colleagues of the Generation of 1898, he emerged from his solitude to contemplate Spain's historical landscape with a sympathetic yet unindulgent eye. His poetic work begins with the publication of ''Soledades'' in 1903. In this short volume many personal links which will characterize his later work are noticeable. In ''Soledades, Galerías.

        "text": "After Machado's experience with the introspective poetry of his first period, he withdrew from the spectacle of his conflictive personality and undertook to witness the general battle of the \"two Spains\", each one struggling to gain the ascendancy. In 1912 he published \"Campos de Castilla\", a collection of poems lyricising the beauty of the Castilian countryside. Just as the poet's own personality revealed mutually destructive elements in the earlier ''Galerías'' and ''Soledades,'' so too did the Cain-Abel Bible story ([[Cain and Abel]]), interpreted in \"La Tierra de Alvargonzález\", later attest to the factions in Spain that shredded one another and the national fabric in an effort to restore unity. At the same time, other poems projected Castilian archetypes that evoked emotions like pathos (\"La mujer manchega\", \"The Manchegan ([[La Mancha]]) Woman\"), revulsion (\"Un criminal\"), and stark rapture (\"Campos de Soria\")."

        "text": "Machado's later poems are a virtual anthropology of Spain's common people, describing their collective psychology, social mores, and historical destiny. He achieves this panorama through basic myths and recurrent, eternal patterns of group behavior. He developed these archetypes in ''Campos de Castilla'' (\"Castilian Fields\") in such key poems as \"La tierra de Alvargonzález\", and \"Por tierras de España\", which are based on Biblical inheritance stories. The metaphors of this second period use geographical and topographical allusions that frame powerful judgments about socio-economic and moral conditions on the Peninsula."

      "text": "Machado's evolution has strong links to larger European trends in the same period. He turned away from the hermetic esthetic principles of post-symbolism and cultivated the dynamic openness of [[social realism]]. Like such French æsthetes as Verlaine, Machado began with a [[fin de siècle]] contemplation of his sensory world, portraying it through memory and the impressions of his private consciousness. And like his socially conscious colleagues of the Generation of 1898, he emerged from his solitude to contemplate Spain's historical landscape with a sympathetic yet unindulgent eye. His poetic work begins with the publication of ''Soledades'' in 1903. In this short volume many personal links which will characterize his later work are noticeable. In ''Soledades, Galerías. Otros poemas'', published in 1907, his voice becomes his own and influences 20th Century poets [[Octavio Paz]], [[Derek Walcott]], and [[Giannina Braschi]] who writes about Machado's impact in her Spanglish classic [[Yo-Yo Boing!]].[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Y6ZC2M/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_2?pf_rd_p=1535523722&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=1611090636&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=14FD0KT86GAR34P2WSMP Yo-Yo Boing!] The most typical feature of his personality is the antipathetic, softly sorrowful tone that can be felt even when he describes real things or common themes of the time, for example abandoned gardens, old parks or fountains: places which he approaches via memory or dreams - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_machado#Works wikipedia]"

      "text": "After Machado's experience with the introspective poetry of his first period, he withdrew from the spectacle of his conflictive personality and undertook to witness the general battle of the \"two Spains\", each one struggling to gain the ascendancy. In 1912 he published \"Campos de Castilla\", a collection of poems lyricising the beauty of the Castilian countryside. Just as the poet's own personality revealed mutually destructive elements in the earlier ''Galerías'' and ''Soledades,'' so too did the Cain-Abel Bible story ([[Cain and Abel]]), interpreted in \"La Tierra de Alvargonzález\", later attest to the factions in Spain that shredded one another and the national fabric in an effort to restore unity. At the same time, other poems projected Castilian archetypes that evoked emotions like pathos (\"La mujer manchega\", \"The Manchegan ([[La Mancha]]) Woman\"), revulsion (\"Un criminal\"), and stark rapture (\"Campos de Soria\")."

      "text": "Machado's later poems are a virtual anthropology of Spain's common people, describing their collective psychology, social mores, and historical destiny. He achieves this panorama through basic myths and recurrent, eternal patterns of group behavior. He developed these archetypes in ''Campos de Castilla'' (\"Castilian Fields\") in such key poems as \"La tierra de Alvargonzález\", and \"Por tierras de España\", which are based on Biblical inheritance stories. The metaphors of this second period use geographical and topographical allusions that frame powerful judgments about socio-economic and moral conditions on the Peninsula."
