The latter may have migrated, most probably along with the spread of Islam, westerly to constitute what are today the lyre-horned cattle of West and Central Africa, including the Fulani cattle. Originally the White Fulani were indigenous to north Nigeria, southeast Niger and northeast Cameroon, owned by both Fulani and Hausa people.

This annual festival is known in the local Fulfulde as the ''Dewgal''. Since the founding of the village in 1818, it has always been the most important Fulani festival. It takes place on a Saturday in November or December; the day is carefully chosen based on the state of pastures and the water levels in the river Niger. During the rainy season, the river swells, and the areas around the village are inundated in water, as the level of the river Niger rises, and turns Diafarabe into an island. The cattle are kept on the lush fields up north or south, but when the West African Monsoon subsides and the drier season returns, the water level drops and the cattle can return home again -\n [http://www.africareview.com/Arts-and-Culture/Courtship-by-the-river-as-cows-return-home/-/979194/1055420/-/v41ix5/-/index.html africareview.com] and [http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/take-me-to-the-river-1350267.html independent.co.uk]"

The cattle are driven into the river, and each herder, with no help from others, loudly encourages the animals to move forward as he stands or swims between them, holding on to the horns of the bulls. The smaller animals don’t have to swim, but are lifted into [[pirogue]]s. When all the cattle are back, they are judged by a panel, which decides whose animals are the \"fattest\". That herder is awarded “best caretaker”, and he is awarded by the community."

This theory is supported by the appearance of the skull as well as the thoracic hump of the Fulani cattle."

This annual festival is known in the local Fulfulde as the ''Dewgal''. Since the founding of the village in 1818, it has always been the most important Fulani festival. It takes place on a Saturday in November or December; the day is carefully chosen based on the state of pastures and the water levels in the river Niger. During the rainy season, the river swells, and the areas around the village are inundated in water, as the level of the river Niger rises, and turns Diafarabe into an island. The cattle are kept on the lush fields up north or south, but when the West African Monsoon subsides and the drier season returns, the water level drops and the cattle can return home again -\n [http://www.africareview.com/Arts-and-Culture/Courtship-by-the-river-as-cows-return-home/-/979194/1055420/-/v41ix5/-/index.html africareview.com] and [http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/take-me-to-the-river-1350267.html independent.co.uk]"
