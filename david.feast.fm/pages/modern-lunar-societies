This was agreed by the University's Guild of Students in autumn 2012. The society now hosts symposiums every two weeks. Any member has always been welcome to suggest a topic for discussion. These meetings occur in a variety of environments from University rooms to local bars. In 2013 the society attempted to change the name of one of the rooms in the Guild of Students to 'The Lunar Room' in honour of the original Birmingham Lunar Society. Like the [[Oxford Union]], the society has always traditionally put a huge emphasis on freedom of speech."

The format for these symposiums is a round table ([[Round table (discussion)]]) style discussion. The society agrees to debate a series of topics in advance of the meeting, and every member is given an opportunity to participate in the discussion. To ensure the discussion retains order they are presided over by a chair. In keeping with the tradition of the society and to help with identification, the chair wears an academic robe."
