This ensures stable nutrient content in the water because of continuous symbiotic cleansing of toxins from the water.[http://biology.westfield.ma.edu/Biol300/sites/default/files/Aquaponic-Production-of-Tilapia-and-Basil.pdf Aquaponic production of tilapia and basil: Comparing a batch and staggered cropping system]"

This type of aquaponics is also known as ''closed-loop aquaponics''.\n* ''Reciprocating aquaponics'': solid media in a container that is alternately flooded and drained utilizing different types of siphon drains. This type of aquaponics is also known as ''flood-and-drain aquaponics'' or ''ebb-and-flow aquaponics''.\n* Other systems use towers that are trickle-fed from the top, [[nutrient film technique]] channels, horizontal [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] pipes with holes for the pots, plastic barrels cut in half with gravel or rafts in them. Each approach has its own benefits.[ A Comparison of Three Different Hydroponic Sub-systems (gravel bed, floating and nutrient film technique) in an Aquaponic Test System]"
