      "text": "Microaquaponics is the symbiotic integration of fish, plants and micro-livestock in a semi-controlled environment. The term was created recently by Australian urban farmer, Gary Donaldson to describe his integrated backyard food production concept. While microponics was also the name given to an obscure grafting method used in hydroponics, Donaldson's use of the term was derived from the integration of micro-livestock (and micro-farming) and the production of fish and plants - aquaponics - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microponics wikipedia]"
