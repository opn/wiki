Through his wide personal and professional networks he connects widely in Nigeria and in other countries in Africa. Through Dadamac he looks outward, enabling fresh initiatives from outside of Africa, in new win-win collaborations.\nAttachab\n\nJohn works in his home area of Kaduna State in North Central Nigeria. One of his plans is to bring together the various Fantsuam Foundation projects at a new eco-friendly site, Attachab. He wants Attachab to become a showcase of good practice - a genuine community which is also a leading centre for research, development and training. Read more about Attachab in this blog. Attachab and its related Knowledge Resource Centre provide the sites for various Dadamac projects.\nJohn and the UK\n\nJohn was a research fellow in the UK, at Leeds University. He stayed on to do a nursing qualification - because he anticipated that, helping people back in rural Nigeria, nursing would be a useful practical skill to have. As a result he has had an unusual work history. He has worked as a University lecturer and professor, helping to educate fellow Nigerians. He has also come back on visits to the UK, taking the opportunity to work as an agency nurse in order to maintain his skills and earn extra money to boost the funds of some of his community projects. (Back home his nursing knowledge is a valuable input to the clinics and other health projects he has helped to set up.)\n\nJohn's ongoing links with the UK mean that there are very few cultural barriers when people in the UK collaborate with him on projects in Nigeria. John comes online weekly to update the UK about the situation in Nigeria. From 2008 to the end of 2012 the information from these meetings was shared each week in Nikki's blog. Blogging has now been taken over by the Fantsuam team and is published through Frances' blog.\n"
