Magnuson Park on the northwestern shore of Lake Washington in Seattle, Washington. The Seattle Arts Commission guided the jury selection headed by Sadao James Hilario, Engineer-in-charge of the GSA Art in Architecture Program for the NOAA Project, and the jury chose five artists from a pool of more than 250 - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Sound_Garden wikipedia]"

      "text": "Because of its location overlooking Lake Washington, its visual and kinetic qualities, and the fact that the Seattle-based rock band Soundgarden took their name from this art work, the installation attracts many visitors. When Soundgarden's frontman Chris Cornell died on May 17, 2017, the sculptures became a makeshift memorial to his life."
