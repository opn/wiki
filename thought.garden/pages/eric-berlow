Examples of his highly cited network ecology publications include a 2009 paper in PNAS for which he was the lead author focused on predicting interaction strengths in food webs,[ ] a 1999 paper in Nature on \"Strong effects of weak interactions in ecological communities\", and a 1994 paper in Ecological Monographs on the keystone species concept.[ ]   He co-authored a paper that was among the top twenty most cited papers  in Environment and Ecology from 1998-2008 entitled \"Biodiversity - global biodiversity scenarios for the year 2100\".
