Since these movements' participants were working class or small farmers the study circles were important in relation to these classes' growing political power in the early 20th century. The issues that were studied were already from the early period broad – it could be as well political and social issues as literature or even school topics. The population as a whole were generally literate as early as the 17th century, and therefore literacy training was not an important concern as a topic for study circles. Other nonformal educations as [[folk high school]]s and popular lectures were already present, when study circles were developed and there were various kinds of connections between these different forms of studies open for adults with only compulsory shooling as formal education."

National educational associations receive annual subsidies ([[subsidy]]) from the national government ([[Central government]]) and work with folk high schools (folkhögskolor), [[university]] short courses, correspondence study ([[Distance education]]) and distance learning ([[Distance education]]), allowing [[citizen]]s to understand and participate more fully in their communities and nation. The Swedish study circle model was successfully transplanted into American culture, most notably in the [[National Issues Forums]] (sponsored by the [[Domestic Policy Association]] in Dayton, Ohio) and the Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen ([[International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers]])'s Study Circle Program which began in 1986."
