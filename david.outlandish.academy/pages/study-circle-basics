Reading material and audio/visual aids are often used to stimulate dialogue."

Study circles may be sponsored or assisted by [[government]] or [[community]] officials and have specific outcome goals such as generating ideas or suggesting courses of action; or they may be entirely independent and [[self-sufficient]], existing simply for the pleasure of increasing the knowledge of their members."

      "text": "Study circles allow complex topics to be broken down into manageable parts. Single session programs can result in meaningful and productive [[dialogue]], but study circles usually involve multiple sessions in order to fully investigate the question at hand. However, a study by Staffan Larson in 2001 concluded that while study circles foster participation they are only partly successful as civic change vehicles since their power to influence social action is weak."
