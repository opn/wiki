      "text": "Action research is either research initiated to solve an immediate problem or a reflective process of progressive problem solving led by individuals working with others in teams or as part of a \"community of practice\" to improve the way they address issues and solve problems. There are two types of action research: participatory and practical. Denscombe (2010, p. 6) writes that an action research strategy's purpose is to solve a particular problem and to produce guidelines for best practice - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_research wikipedia]"

      "text": "Action research involves actively participating in a change situation, often via an existing organization, whilst simultaneously conducting research. Action research can also be undertaken by larger organizations or institutions, assisted or guided by professional researchers, with the aim of improving their strategies, practices and knowledge of the environments within which they practice. As designers and stakeholders, researchers work with others to propose a new course of action to help their community improve its work practices."

      "text": "Kurt Lewin, then a professor at MIT, first coined the term \"action research\" in 1944. In his 1946 paper \"Action Research and Minority Problems\" he described action research as \"a comparative research on the conditions and effects of various forms of social action and research leading to social action\" that uses \"a spiral of steps, each of which is composed of a circle of planning, action and fact-finding about the result of the action\"."
