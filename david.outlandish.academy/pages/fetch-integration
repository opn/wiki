At each place we would interview the chef about his favourite meal and let him prepare it. As the chef is being interviewed we are documenting individual ingredients in slow motion. Each one tells a story of its origin, locally sourced or brought over, organic, treated with chemicals and so forth. This gives us a picture of the final meal. We also document the final meal along with the chef’s portrait. All these are done in slow motion, very little movement and we concentrate on individual ingredients as still life objects. \nThe transitions between the places are faster and reveal the environment around. \nB footage of the streets walking or from a car window. At this moment we can mix in music local to the venue and continue our journey. With places which use locally sourced ingredients (Crop Drop) we can follow the story of our hero ingredient all the way to it’s roots (literally).\n\n\n# [[FEAST Visual Style]]\n\nThe FEAST chat-bot that we will create with Fetch will facilitate and encourage an ongoing conversation around food. The festival will be marketed to local communities and give them an opportunity to participate in these conversations. We include some sample images / flyers / mood boards regarding the visual style of the festival and marketing material for your feedback.\n"
