The term ‘Self’ and what it constitutes is highly debated in consciousness and cognitive studies (philosophically, psychologically and physiologically). It is too complex to adequately cover in this paper, but offers an opportunity for a future paper.\n- **(12)** Mental constructions of others are highly personalised and often constitute more of the individual making the construction, rather than the ‘real’ and ‘existing’ person (personal meeting with Professor Gerald Midgley, September 2013).\n- **(13)** The Bounded Object is created by an individual (constructivism). I use the term ‘Bounded’ as it is the final state of ‘binding’, which also suggests the potential for ‘unbinding’ an object. This is different from the notion of a ‘boundary object’ which is a socially ‘agreed’ concept, idea, rule, etc."

The term ‘Self’ and what it constitutes is highly debated in consciousness and cognitive studies (philosophically, psychologically and physiologically). It is too complex to adequately cover in this paper, but offers an opportunity for a future paper.\n- **(12)** Mental constructions of others are highly personalised and often constitute more of the individual making the construction, rather than the ‘real’ and ‘existing’ person (personal meeting with Professor Gerald Midgley, September 2013).\n- **(13)** The Bounded Object is created by an individual (constructivism). I use the term ‘Bounded’ as it is the final state of ‘binding’, which also suggests the potential for ‘unbinding’ an object. This is different from the notion of a ‘boundary object’ which is a socially ‘agreed’ concept, idea, rule, etc."

In CST, the roles of values, ethics and morality are regarded as central. They are not explicit in the Triage; rather, they are looked upon as RFs."

This is especially important in social contexts where ‘messes’ (Ackoff, 1999) arise due to ‘justification break-offs’ beyond rationality (Ulrich, 1987), and where marginalisation can occur as Bounded Objects become ‘sacred’ or ‘profane’ (Midgley, 1992; Midgley, 2000; Cordoba-Pachon, 2010).\n"
