Especially if you use several different types of standard data formats, such as JPEG, GIF, or XML, document packages make accessing and managing that data much easier.\n\nDefining Your Document Directory Structure\n\nApple does not prescribe any specific structure for document packages. The contents and organization of the package directory are left to you. You are encouraged, however, to create either a flat directory structure or use the framework bundle structure, which involves placing your files in a top-level Resources subdirectory. (For more information about the bundle structure of frameworks, see Framework Bundles.)\n\nRegistering Your Document Type\n\nTo register a document as a package, you must modify the document type information in your application’s information property list (Info.plist) file. The CFBundleDocumentTypes key stores information about the document types your application supports. For each document package type, include the LSTypeIsPackage key with an appropriate value.
