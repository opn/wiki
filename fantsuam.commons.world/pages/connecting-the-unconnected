It is also interesting that Governments and private sector are also showing increasing interest in ‘connecting the unconnected’ with techniques such as balloons,  planes, limited access zero rating plans, points of free connectivity in public areas etc. Fantsuam Foundation regards this as a positive development to create an internet for the remote and unconnected poor."

It was therefore very helpful to bring together about sixteen Community Network Initiatives across Africa, for this summit. There were case studies from Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, and Zambia. To underscore the centrality of the communities in these efforts and the role of community leaders, Chief Chikwanta from Zambia was also in attendance."

All the case studies demonstrated grassroots, bottom-up approach of deploying innovative solutions, using available, albeit, limited resources to meet the communication needs of our host communities. For example, Fantsuam Foundation reported its approach to the menace of Boko Haram and related sectarian violence in parts of northern Nigeria that has led to severe disruption of primary and secondary educational services. This approach consists of deploying Continuing Professional Development capacity building for internally displaced teachers who have lost valuable opportunities to improve their skills and knowledge."
