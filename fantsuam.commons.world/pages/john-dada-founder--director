He stayed on to do a nursing qualification - because he anticipated that, helping people back in rural Nigeria, nursing would be a useful practical skill to have. As a result he has had an unusual work history. He has worked as a University lecturer and professor, helping to educate fellow Nigerians. He has also come back on visits to the UK, taking the opportunity to work as an agency nurse in order to maintain his skills and earn extra money to boost the funds of some of his community projects. (Back home his nursing knowledge is a valuable input to the clinics and other health projects he has helped to set up.)"
