      "text": "The Garden of Eden (Hebrew גַּן עֵדֶן, Gan ʿEḏen) or (often) Paradise, is the biblical \"garden of God\", described most notably in the Book of Genesis chapters 2 and 3, and also in the Book of Ezekiel. Genesis 13:10 refers to the \"garden of God\" (not called Eden by name), and the \"trees of the garden\" are mentioned in Ezekiel 31. The Book of Zechariah and the Book of Psalms also refer to trees and water in relation to the temple without explicitly mentioning Eden - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden wikipedia]"

      "text": "Traditionally, scholars favored deriving the name \"Eden\" from the Akkadian edinnu, derived from a Sumerian word edin meaning \"plain\" or \"steppe\". Chaim Cohen, however, writes that Eden is more closely related to an Aramaic root word meaning \"fruitful, well-watered.\" Another interpretation associates the name \"Eden\" with a Hebrew word for \"pleasure\"; thus the Douay-Rheims Bible in Genesis 2:8 has the wording \"And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure\" (rather than \"a garden in Eden\"). The Hebrew term is translated \"pleasure\" in Sarah's secret saying in Genesis 18:12."

      "text": "Much like records of the great flood, the creation story and the account of the confusion of languages, the story of Eden echoes the Mesopotamian myth of a king, as a primordial man, who is placed in a divine garden to guard the Tree of Life. The Hebrew Bible depicts Adam and Eve as walking around the Garden of Eden naked due to their innocence. Eden and its rivers may signify the real Jerusalem, the Temple of Solomon, or the Promised Land. It may also represent the divine garden on Zion, and the mountain of God, which was also Jerusalem. The imagery of the Garden, with its serpent and cherubim, has been compared to the images of the Solomonic Temple with its copper serpent (the nehushtan) and guardian cherubs."
