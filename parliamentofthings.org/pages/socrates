An enigmatic figure, he made no writings, and is known chiefly through the accounts of classical writers writing after his lifetime, particularly his students Plato and Xenophon. Other sources include the contemporaneous Antisthenes, Aristippus, and Aeschines of Sphettos. (Aristophanes, a playwright, is the only source to have written during his lifetime. ) - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates wikipedia]"
