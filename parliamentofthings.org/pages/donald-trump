      "text": "Trump had long expressed interest in politics; he eventually entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated sixteen opponents in the primaries. Commentators described his political positions as populist, protectionist, and nationalist. His campaign received extensive free media coverage; many of his public statements were controversial or false. Trump won the general election on November 8, 2016, in a surprise victory against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. He became the oldest and wealthiest person ever to assume the presidency, the first without prior military or government service, and the fifth to have won the election despite losing the popular vote. The Russian government interfered in the election to support his candidacy."

      "text": "In the first months of his presidency, Trump reversed several policies of former President Barack Obama, withdrawing the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris Climate Agreement, undoing parts of the Cuban Thaw, and urging Congress to replace the Affordable Care Act with the American Health Care Act. Trump appointed Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He ordered a travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, but several federal courts issued preliminary injunctions preventing its implementation. U.S. war efforts expanded in Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen. Multiple protests stemmed from his election and some of his policies. After Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey, former CIA Director Robert Mueller was appointed Special Counsel to take charge of the investigation into Russian interference, links with Trump associates and potential obstruction of justice."
