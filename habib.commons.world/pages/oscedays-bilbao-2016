Many questions and good conversations.\nwe just settled in Bilbao on January 2016, so for us, as « newcomers »,  organising that event would be the opportunity to connect with local people from different disciplines, co-making prototypes and sharing personal stories, thus creating a temporary creative networking, witht the aim of building connexions that would last and get richer and richer over time;\nputting « opensource » and « circular economy » into practice and sharing someof our personal values in that process : autonomy, sustainability, poetry, remix, benevolence,etc.\n\nDefining :\nOPENSOURCE : usually defined as sharing the source code (in software programming for example) so that other people can replicate or play with it to build upon it. In my opinion, the question is : what is the code of what you are building ?
