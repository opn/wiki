N, soil NH4, soil NO3, and light penetration). 289 plots were designed with varying amounts of the three controlled factors. Each plot contained up to 32 perennial savannah-grassland species representing up to five plant functional groups. These species were not equal in their functional impact to the ecosystem."

Following its release, the Issues authors were accused of being deliberately misleading, presenting controversial findings as fact. Wardle charged that the diversity experiments reported in Tilman et al., despite being stated in “Issues” as solid fact, were confounded by an experimental design that assumed \"that biological communities are randomly assembled with regard to the ecosystem property being investigated.\" This phenomenon is termed the \"selection probability effect.\" The Issues article, however, does not present this opinion as fact. It discusses the sampling effect as a possible mechanism, not as an irrefutable mechanism. Furthermore, its conclusions are marked by uncertainty: although species diversity and functional diversity are correlated, functional diversity may play a larger role in ecosystem processes than the total number of species."
