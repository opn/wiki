Humankind has entered what is sometimes called the Earth's sixth major extinction.[http://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/scientists-build-case-sixth-extinction-say-it-could-kill-us-n378586 Scientists Build Case for 'Sixth Extinction' ... and Say It Could Kill Us] Most experts agree that human activities have accelerated the rate of species extinction. The exact rate remains controversial – perhaps 100 to 1000 times the normal background rate of extinction.[ ] A 2010 study found that \"marine phytoplankton – the vast range of tiny algae species accounting for roughly half of Earth's total photosynthetic biomass – had declined substantially in the world's oceans over the past century. From 1950 alone, algal biomass decreased by around 40%, probably in response to ocean warming ([[Global Warming]]) – and that the decline had gathered pace in recent years.[http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100728/full/news.2010.379.html Ocean greenery under warming stress] Some authors have postulated that without human impacts the [[biodiversity]] of the planet would continue to grow at an exponential rate.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates\"/> – implying that human activities accelerate or exacerbate global warming."
