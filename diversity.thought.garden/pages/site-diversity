A diversity scheme is typically required when using frequencies in the Ka, V, or W-band. The downlink transmissions of satellites cover very large areas, that will have different weather. The site diversity technique consists of linking two or more ground stations receiving the same signal: this way, if the signal is heavily attenuated in one area, another ground stations can compensate it. These intense rain areas, for example, supercells, often have a horizontal length of no more than a few kilometers: putting the ground stations at a sufficient distance the possibility of rain fade in the downlink signal will be reduced - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_diversity wikipedia]"
