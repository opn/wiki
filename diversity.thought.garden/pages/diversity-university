        "text": "Diversity University was the first MOO dedicated specifically for education. Like other MUDs, it was an online realm that allowed people to interact in real time by connecting to a central server, assuming a virtual identity within that realm, \"teleporting\" (in other words, transporting your character) or \"walking\" to virtual rooms, and holding text-based conversations with others who had entered the same virtual room. The MOO server kept track of which characters were in each virtual \"room,\" so that the comments of each character would be sent back to the computers of every other person whose character was \"in\" the same virtual \"room.\" What distinguished Diversity University from other MOOs was its central structuring metaphor as a virtual university campus, as well as its pioneering use for actual online classes - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_University wikipedia]"
