It attracts primary school groups around the year and its exhibits are 'hands on' so that everything can be played with and examined. The centre is a registered non-profit organization that is funded by the public and donations from local corporate sponsors. Birthday parties and other events for children may be held here by prior arrangement. - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen_Science_Centre wikipedia]"
