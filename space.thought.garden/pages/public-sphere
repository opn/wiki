Communication scholar Gerard A. Hauser defines it as \"a discursive space in which individuals and groups associate to discuss matters of mutual interest and, where possible, to reach a common judgment about them\". The public sphere can be seen as \"a theater in modern societies in which political participation is enacted through the medium of talk\" and \"a realm of social life in which public opinion can be formed\" - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sphere wikipedia]"

Whereas the \"sphere of public authority\" dealt with the state, or realm of the police, and the ruling class,or the feudal authorities (church, princes and nobility) the \"authentic 'public sphere'\", in a political sense, arose at that time from within the private realm, specifically, in connection with literary activities, the world of letters. This new public sphere spanned the public and the private realms, and \"through the vehicle of public opinion it put the state in touch with the needs of society\". \"This area is conceptually distinct from the state: it [is] a site for the production and circulation of discourses that can in principle be critical of the state.\" The public sphere \"is also distinct from the official economy; it is not an arena of market relations but rather one of the discursive relations, a theater for debating and deliberating rather than for buying and selling\". These distinctions between \"state apparatuses, economic markets, and democratic associations...are essential to democratic theory\". The people themselves came to see the public sphere as a regulatory institution against the authority of the state. The study of the public sphere centers on the idea of participatory democracy, and how public opinion becomes political action."

Much of the debate over the public sphere involves what is the basic theoretical structure of the public sphere, how information is deliberated in the public sphere, and what influence the public sphere has over society."
