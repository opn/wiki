        "text": "Kim Stanley Robinson (born March 23, 1952) is an American writer of science fiction. He has published nineteen novels and numerous short stories but is best known for his Mars trilogy. His work has been translated into 24 languages. Many of his novels and stories have ecological, cultural, and political themes running through them and feature scientists as heroes. Robinson has won numerous awards, including the Hugo Award for Best Novel, the Nebula Award for Best Novel and the World Fantasy Award. Robinson's work has been labeled by The Atlantic as \"the gold-standard of realistic, and highly literary, science-fiction writing.\" According to an article in The New Yorker, Robinson is \"generally acknowledged as one of the greatest living science-fiction writers.\" - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Stanley_Robinson wikipedia]"
