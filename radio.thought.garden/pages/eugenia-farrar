Ben Gross, the longtime radio editor of The Daily News, reported that she had not sung more than a few notes when a wireless operator at the Navy Yard jumped. ''I hear a woman singing!'' he told his lieutenant, who grabbed the headphones.\n\nThe lieutenant, Mr. Gross wrote, was ''fearful of the enlisted man's sanity.'' But he, too, heard Mrs. Farrar.\n\nPerhaps he also heard Lee De Forest, the radio pioneer whose laboratory was the scene of the performance, shout, ''Encore!''\n\nPerhaps the lieutenant heard Mrs. Farrar sing a second song, ''Just a-Wearying for You.''\n\nOr perhaps not. It is known that the lieutenant grabbed a telephone and called The New York Herald. ''His call was transferred to a rewrite man,'' Mr. Gross wrote in his 1954 book ''I Looked and I Listened.'' The reporter was ''convinced that the newspaper was the target of a practical joker,'' Mr. Gross wrote, and ''called back a few minutes later to check on the authenticity of the information.''\n\n''The rewrite man dashed off a brief story which was buried on page 5 of next morning's Herald,'' he wrote.
