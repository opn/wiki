He had over 180 patents, but also a tumultuous career—he boasted that he made, then lost, four fortunes. He was also involved in several major patent lawsuits, spent a substantial part of his income on legal bills, and was even tried (and acquitted) for mail fraud. His most famous invention, in 1906, was the three-element \"Audion\" (triode) vacuum tube, the first practical amplification device. Although De Forest had only a limited understanding of how it worked, it was the foundation of the field of electronics, making possible radio broadcasting, long distance telephone lines, and talking motion pictures, among countless other applications - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_de_Forest wikipedia]"

The small tube <i>(left)</i> was a low power one watt Audion used in radio receivers.  The large tube <i>(right)</i> was a high power 250 watt tube used in radio transmitters, which De Forest called an \"oscillion\".

The top metal electrode is the plate.  The zigzag metal wire partly visible under it is the grid.  The filament was originally under that, attached to the wires at left, but has burned out.  As many Audions did, this model had two filaments (indicated by the four filament supply wires) so that when one burned out the \"spare\" could be used.  The filament wires were attached to the screw terminal at left, while the grid and plate terminals were brought out through the right end of the glass envelope to the two wires at right.  Tube belongs to History of San Jose, Perham Collection of Early Electronics.\n- [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Triode_tube_1906.jpg wikimedia.org]\n</p></div>"
