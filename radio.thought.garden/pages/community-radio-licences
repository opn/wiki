With this unfolding scenario, we need to consider all measures to contain the disease. Nigeria should no longer delay the approval of licences for community radios."

This type of misinformation can be quickly checked through appropriate messages on community radios – a very localized medium under the control of its people using their language. The widening distrust between the public and healthcare professionals is a major obstacle in the containment of this disease. In Uganda during a similar health care crisis, a simple but highly effective approach was employed to gain the trust of people through intensive communication using community radio. The role of local community and traditional leaders was recognized and they worked closely with health care staff to convey appropriate information."
