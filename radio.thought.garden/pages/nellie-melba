She became one of the most famous singers of the late Victorian era and the early 20th century. She was the first Australian to achieve international recognition as a classical musician. She took the pseudonym \"Melba\" from Melbourne, her home town - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellie_Melba wikipedia]"

        "text": "Melba studied singing in Melbourne and made a modest success in performances there. After a brief and unsuccessful marriage, she moved to Europe in search of a singing career. Failing to find engagements in London in 1886, she studied in Paris and soon made a great success there and in Brussels. Returning to London she quickly established herself as the leading lyric soprano at Covent Garden from 1888. She soon achieved further success in Paris and elsewhere in Europe, and later at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, debuting there in 1893. Her repertoire was small; in her whole career she sang no more than 25 roles and was closely identified with only ten. She was known for her performances in French and Italian opera, but sang little German opera."

She returned to Australia frequently during the 20th century, singing in opera and concerts, and had a house built for her near Melbourne. She was active in the teaching of singing at the Melbourne Conservatorium. Melba continued to sing until the last months of her life and made a large number of \"farewell\" appearances. Her death, in Australia, was news across the English-speaking world, and her funeral was a major national event. The Australian $100 note features her image."

She was the first artist of international renown to participate in direct radio broadcasts. Radio enthusiasts across the country heard her, and the broadcast was reportedly heard from as far away as New York. People listening on the radio barely heard a few scratches of the trill and two arias she sang. Further radio broadcasts would include her Covent Garden farewell performance, and a 1927 \"Empire Broadcast\" (broadcast throughout the British Empire, by radio stations AWA and 2FC, Sydney, on Monday 5 September 1927; it was relayed by the BBC London on Sunday 4 September)."

        "text": "Melba's first recordings were made around 1895, recorded on cylinders at the Bettini ([[Gianni Bettini]]) Phonograph Lab in New York. A reporter from Phonoscope magazine was impressed: \"The next cylinder was labelled 'Melba' and was truly wonderful, the phonograph reproducing her wonderful voice in a marvellous manner, especially the high notes which soared away above the staff and were rich and clear.\" Melba was less impressed: \"'Never again,' I said to myself as I listened to the scratching, screeching result. 'Don't tell me I sing like that, or I shall go away and live on a desert island.'\" The recordings never reached the general public&nbsp;– destroyed on Melba's orders, it is suspected&nbsp;– and Melba would not venture into a recording studio for another eight years. Melba can be heard singing on several [[Mapleson Cylinders]], early attempts at live recording, made by the Metropolitan Opera House librarian Lionel Mapleson in the auditorium there during performances. These cylinders are often poor in quality, but they preserve something of the quality of the young Melba's voice and performance that is sometimes lacking from her commercial recordings."

        "text": "Melba made numerous gramophone ([[gramophone record]]) ([[phonograph]]) records of her voice in England and America between 1904 (when she was already in her 40s) and 1926 for the [[Gramophone & Typewriter Company]] and the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]]. Most of these recordings, consisting of operatic arias, duets and ensemble pieces and songs, have been re-released on CD. The poor audio fidelity of the Melba recordings reflects the limitations of the early days of commercial sound recording. Melba's acoustical recordings ([[Gramophone record#\"Acoustical\" recording]]) (especially those made after her initial 1904 session) fail to capture vital overtones to the voice, leaving it without the body and warmth it possessed&nbsp;– albeit to a limited degree&nbsp;– in life. Despite this, they still reveal Melba to have had an almost seamlessly pure [[lyric soprano]] voice with effortless coloratura, a smooth legato and accurate intonation.<ref name=gram2003 /> Melba had perfect pitch; the critic Michael Aspinall says of her complete London recordings issued on LP, that there are only two lapses from pitch in the entire set.<ref name=aspinall /> Like Patti, and unlike the more vibrant-voiced Tetrazzini, Melba's exceptional purity of tone was probably one of the principal reasons why British audiences, with their strong choral and sacred music traditions, idolised her."

The programme included Act 2 of ''[[Roméo et Juliette]]'' (not recorded because the tenor Charles Hackett was not under contract to HMV), followed by the opening of Act 4 of ''Otello'' (Desdemona's \"Willow Song\" and \"Ave Maria\") and Acts 3 and 4 of ''La bohème'' (with Aurora Rettore, Browning Mummery, John Brownlee and others). The conductor was Vincenzo Bellezza. At the conclusion Lord Stanley of Alderley ([[Arthur Stanley, 5th Baron Sheffield]]) made a formal address and Melba gave an emotional farewell speech. In a pioneering venture, eleven sides (78rpm) were recorded via a landline to Gloucester House (London), though in the event only three of these were published. The full series (including both speeches) was included in a 1976 HMV reissue."

This, and the technical inadequacies of the early recording process (discs were frequently recorded faster or slower than the supposed standard of 78rpm, whilst the conditions of the cramped recording studios&nbsp;– kept very warm to keep the wax at the necessary softness when cutting&nbsp;– would wreak havoc with instrumental tuning during recording sessions), means that playing her recordings back in the speed and pitch she made them at is not always a simple matter."

Her repertoire was small; in her whole career she sang no more than 25 roles and was closely identified with only ten. She was known for her performances in French and Italian opera, but sang little German opera."

She returned to Australia frequently during the 20th century, singing in opera and concerts, and had a house built for her near Melbourne. She was active in the teaching of singing at the Melbourne Conservatorium. Melba continued to sing until the last months of her life and made a large number of \"farewell\" appearances. Her death, in Australia, was news across the English-speaking world, and her funeral was a major national event. The Australian $100 note features her image."

A reporter from Phonoscope magazine was impressed: \"The next cylinder was labelled 'Melba' and was truly wonderful, the phonograph reproducing her wonderful voice in a marvellous manner, especially the high notes which soared away above the staff and were rich and clear.\" Melba was less impressed: \"'Never again,' I said to myself as I listened to the scratching, screeching result. 'Don't tell me I sing like that, or I shall go away and live on a desert island.'\" "

The programme included Act 2 of ''[[Roméo et Juliette]]'' (not recorded because the tenor Charles Hackett was not under contract to HMV), followed by the opening of Act 4 of ''Otello'' (Desdemona's \"Willow Song\" and \"Ave Maria\") and Acts 3 and 4 of ''La bohème'' (with Aurora Rettore, Browning Mummery, John Brownlee and others). The conductor was Vincenzo Bellezza. At the conclusion Lord Stanley of Alderley ([[Arthur Stanley, 5th Baron Sheffield]]) made a formal address and Melba gave an emotional farewell speech. In a pioneering venture, eleven sides (78rpm) were recorded via a landline to Gloucester House (London), though in the event only three of these were published. The full series (including both speeches) was included in a 1976 HMV reissue."

This, and the technical inadequacies of the early recording process (discs were frequently recorded faster or slower than the supposed standard of 78rpm, whilst the conditions of the cramped recording studios&nbsp;– kept very warm to keep the wax at the necessary softness when cutting&nbsp;– would wreak havoc with instrumental tuning during recording sessions), means that playing her recordings back in the speed and pitch she made them at is not always a simple matter."

She was the first artist of international renown to participate in direct radio broadcasts. Radio enthusiasts across the country heard her, and the broadcast was reportedly heard from as far away as New York. People listening on the radio barely heard a few scratches of the trill and two arias she sang. Further radio broadcasts would include her Covent Garden farewell performance, and a 1927 \"Empire Broadcast\" (broadcast throughout the British Empire, by radio stations AWA and 2FC, Sydney, on Monday 5 September 1927; it was relayed by the BBC London on Sunday 4 September)."
