        "text": "The [[History of broadcasting in Australia]] has been shaped for over a century by the problem of communication across long distances, coupled with a strong base in a wealthy society with a deep taste for aural communications.  Australia developed its own system, through its own engineers, manufacturers, retailers, newspapers, entertainment services, and news agencies. The government set up the first radio system, and business interests marginalized the hobbyists and amateurs.   The Labor Party was especially interested in radio because it allowed them to bypass the newspapers, which were mostly controlled by the opposition. Both parties agreed on the need for a national system, and in 1932 set up the Australian Broadcasting Commission, as a government agency that was largely separate from political interference. The first commercial broadcasters, originally known as \"B\" class stations, were on the air as early as 1925. The number of stations (commercial and national) remained relatively dormant throughout World War II and in the post-war era."

        "text": "As with most countries, most Australian stations originally broadcast music interspersed with such things as talks, coverage of sporting events, church broadcasts, weather, news and time signals of various types. Virtually all stations also had programs of interest to women, and children's sessions. From the outset, A Class stations' peak-hour evening programs often consisted of live broadcasts from various [[theatres]], i.e. [[dramas]], [[operas]], [[musicals]], [[variety shows]], [[vaudeville]], etc. The first dramas especially written for radio were transmitted in the mid-1920s. By the 1930s, the ABC was transmitting a number of British programs sourced from the BBC, and commercial stations were receiving a number of US programs, particularly dramas. However, in the 1940s, war-time restrictions made it difficult to access overseas programs and, therefore, the amount of Australian dramatic material increased. As well as using original ideas and scripts, there were a number of local versions of overseas programs. Initially, much of the music broadcast in Australia was from live studio concerts.  However, the amount of gramophone ([[gramophone record]]) (and [[piano roll]]) music soon increased dramatically, particularly on commercial stations."

After World War II the independent Colgate-Palmolive radio production unit was formed. It poached most major radio stars from the various stations. Until the 1950s, the popular image of the whole family seated around a set in the living room was the most accepted way of listening to radio. Therefore, most stations had to be all things to all people, and specialised programming was not really thought about at this stage (it did not come in until the late 1950s). Because of this, programming on most stations was pretty much the same."

They both operated in eras prior to the universal establishment of rural radio stations. 2XT was designed and operated by AWA within the State of [[New South Wales]], from a NSW Railways ([[New South Wales Government Railways]]) train, between November 1925 and December 1927. 2XT, which stood for ''experimental train'', visited over 100 rural centres. Engineers would set up a transmitting aerial and the station would then begin broadcasting.  This led to the further sales of AWA products. 3YB provided a similar service in rural Victoria ([[Victoria (Australia)]]) between October 1931 and November 1935. Initially, the station operated from a Ford ([[Ford Motor Company]]) car and a Ford truck, but from 17 October 1932 they operated from a converted 1899 former Royal Train carriage. Whilst the engineers were setting up the station's 50-watt transmitter in the town being visited, salesmen would sign up advertisers for the fortnight that 3YB would broadcast from that region. The station was on the air from 6.00 and 10.00 pm daily, and its 1,000-record library was divided into set four-hour programs, one for each of 14 days. In other words, the music broadcast from each town was identical. The station was operated by Vic Dinenny, but named after announcer Jack '''Y'''oung from '''B'''allarat. On 18 January 1936, Dinenny set up [[3YB]] [[Warnambool]], followed on 18 May 1937 by 3UL ([[3GG]]) [[Warragul]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>"

The broadcasting station was constructed and operated by AWA ([[Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)]]) and was initially given the ham radio ([[Amateur radio]]) callsign VK9MI but was later 9MI. (At this time, the \"9\" in the callsign was aberrationary [see \"Call Signs, above].) The station made an experimental broadcast before leaving Northern Ireland, and a number of such broadcasts at sea, on the way to Australia. 9MI's first official broadcast in April 1939 was made from the [[Great Australian Bight]].<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> The station broadcast on [[short wave]], usually a couple of times per week, but many of its programs were relayed to commercial medium wave stations that were also owned by AWA. The 9MI manager and announcer (and probably the only member of staff) was Eileen Foley. 9MI ceased broadcasting at the commencement of World War II in September 1939. The Kanimbla was commissioned as a [[Royal Navy]] (later [[Royal Australian Navy]]) vessel with the name HMS/HMAS Kanimbla.  It had an extremely prominent and successful war-time career."

Canadians were swept up in the radio craze and built crystal sets to listen to American stations while The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada offered its first commercially produced radio-broadcast receiver (Model \"C\") in 1921, followed by its \"Marconiphone\" Model I in 1923. Main themes in the history include the development of the engineering  technology; the construction of stations across the country and the building of networks; the widespread purchase and use of radio and television sets by the general public; debates regarding state versus private ownership of stations; financing of the broadcasts media through the government, license fees, and advertising; the changing content of the programming; the impact of the programming on Canadian identity; the media's influence on shaping audience responses to music, sports and politics; the role of the Québec government; Francophone versus Anglophone cultural tastes; the role of other ethnic groups and First Nations; fears of American cultural imperialism via the airwaves; and the impact of the Internet and smartphones on traditional broadcasting media."

        "text": "Radio signals carried long distances, and a number of American stations could easily be received in parts of Canada.  The first Canadian station was CFCF, originally an experimental station from the Marconi Company in Montreal. Civilian use of Wireless Telegraphy had been forbidden in Canada for the duration of World War I. The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada was the only one to retain the right to continue radio experiments for military use.  This proved instrumental in giving the company a lead in developing an experimental radio broadcasting station immediately after the war. The first radio broadcast in Canada was accomplished by The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada in Montreal on December 1, 1919 under the call sign XWA (for \"Experimental Wireless Apparatus\") from its Williams Street factory. The station began regular programming on May 20, 1920 and its call letters were changed to CFCF on November 4, 1920. In Toronto, the first radio station was operated by the ''Toronto Star'' newspaper.  Station CKCE began in April 1922. and were so well received that the Star pushed forward with its own studios and transmitting facilities, returning to the air as CFCA in late June 1922.  In Montreal, another newspaper, ''La Presse'', put its own station, CKAC on the air in late September 1922.  Because there were governmental limitations on radio frequencies back then, CKAC and CFCF alternated—one would broadcast one night, and the other would broadcast the night after that. For a time, CKAC was broadcasting some programs in French, and some in English: in 1924, for example, the station rebroadcast fifteen Boston Bruins hockey games from station WBZ in Boston.  Meanwhile, in other Canadian provinces, 1922 was also the year for their first stations, including CJCE in Vancouver, and CQCA (which soon became CHCQ) in Calgary."

        "text": "As radio grew in popularity during the mid-1920s, a problem arose:  the U.S. stations dominated the airwaves and with a limited number of frequencies available for broadcasters to use, it was the American stations that seemed to get most of them. This was despite an agreement with the US Department of Commerce (which supervised broadcasting in the years prior to the Federal Radio Commission) that a certain number of frequencies were reserved exclusively for Canadian signals. But if a US station wanted one of those frequencies, the Department of Commerce seemed unwilling to stop it, much to the frustration of Canadian owners who wanted to put stations on the air. The Canadian government and the US government began negotiations in late 1926, in hopes of finding a satisfactory solution.  Meanwhile, in 1928, Canada got its first network, operated by the Canadian National Railways. CNR had already made itself known in radio since 1923, thanks in large part to the leadership of CNR's president, Sir Henry Thornton. The company began equipping its trains with radio receivers, and allowed passengers to hear radio stations from Canada and the US. In 1924, CN began building its own stations, and by 1928, it was able to create a network. In 1932, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission was formed, and in 1936, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the country's national radio service, made its debut."

Due to the proximity of Cuba to the U.S. state of Florida, some Cubans would try to listen to the American stations whose signals reached the island. But there was no radio station in Cuba until 1922.  The arrival of the first radio station, PWX, was greeted with enthusiasm. PWX, owned by the Cuban Telephone Company, was located in Havana.  It was a joint venture with the International Telephone and Telegraph Company of New York.  PWX debuted on the air on October 10, 1922.  PWX broadcast programs in both English and Spanish, and its signal was easily received at night in a number of American cities. Another early station in Cuba was owned by Frank Jones, an American amateur radio operator and Chief Engineer of the Tuinucu Sugar Company.  The station used amateur call letters, and went on the air as 6KW. In late 1928, PWX began using the call letters CMC.  Its slogan was \"If you hear 'La Paloma,' you are in tune with CMC.\"  As with many other countries, interest in radio expanded, and by 1932, Cuba had more than thirty stations, spread out in cities all over the island."

        "text": "[[Radio Paris]] began operations in 1922, followed by Radio Toulouse and Radio Lyon.  Before 1940, 14 commercial and 12 public sector radio stations were in operation. The government exerted tight control over radio broadcasting. Political debate was not encouraged. In the 1932 election campaign, for example, the opposition was allowed one broadcast while the incumbent made numerous campaign broadcasts. Radio was a potentially powerful new medium, but France was quite laggard in consumer ownership of radio sets, With 5 million radio receivers in 1937, compared to over 8 million and both Britain and Germany, and 26 million in the United States. The government imposed very strict controls on news dissemination. After 1938, stations were allowed only three brief daily bulletins, of seven minutes each, to cover all the day's news. The Prime Minister's office closely supervised the news items that were to be broadcast.  As war approached, Frenchmen learned little or nothing about it from the radio. The government thought that policy wise, because it wanted no interference in its policies. The unexpected result, however, was the Frenchman were puzzled and uncertain great crises erupted in 1938-39, and their morale and support for government policies was much weaker than in Britain."

It was unique in that at least one of its announcers was a woman, Akiko Midorikawa. JOAK was followed soon after by JOBK in Osaka and JOCK in Nagoya.  The National Broadcasting Service, today known as NHK (Nippon Hoso Kyokai), began in August 1926. All stations were supported by licensing fees:  in 1926, for example, people wishing to receive a permit to own a radio set paid a fee of one yen a month to the government. Programming on Japanese stations of the 1920s included music, news, language instruction (lessons were offered in English, French and German) and educations talks.  These early stations broadcast on average about eight hours of programs a day."

        "text": "Amateur radio was very popular in Mexico; while most of the hams were male, notably Constantino de Tarnava, acknowledged in some sources as Mexico's first amateur radio operator, one of the early ham radio operators was female—Maria Dolores Estrada. But commercial radio was difficult to achieve, due to a federal regulation forbidding any broadcasts that were not for the benefit of the Mexican government. Still, in November 1923, CYL in Mexico City went on the air, featuring music (both folk songs and popular dance concerts), religious services, and news. CYL used as its slogans \"El Universal\" and \"La Casa del Radio\", and it won over the government, by giving political candidates the opportunity to use the station to campaign. Its signal was so powerful that it was even received in Canada sometimes. Pressure from listeners and potential station owners also contributed to the government relenting and allowing more stations to go on the air. In 1931, the \"C\" call letters were all changed to \"X\" call letters (XE being reserved for broadcasting), and by 1932, Mexico had nearly forty radio stations, ten of which were in Mexico City."

There were radio stations operating in the Philippines, including one owned by American businessman named Henry Hermann, as early as 1922, according to some sources; not much documentation about that period of time exists.  In the autumn of 1927, KZRM in Manila, owned by the Radio Corporation of the Philippines, went on the air. The Radio Corporation of the Philippines was a subsidiary of American company RCA (Radio Corporation of America). By 1932, the island had three radio stations: KRZC in Cebu, as well as KZIB (owned by a department store) and KZFM, the government-owned station in Manila. Of the stations listed by Pierre Key, KZFM was the strongest, with 50,000 watts.  Two radio networks were ultimately created:  one, the Manila Broadcasting Company, began as a single station, KZRH in Manila, in July 1939, and after World War II, in 1946, the station's owners began to develop their network by buying other radio properties. As for the Philippine Broadcasting Company, it too began with one station (KZFM), and received its new name in mid-1946, after the Philippines became an independent country. At the end of 1946, the new network had six stations.  Both KZRH and KZFM also affiliated with American networks; the stations wanted to have access to certain popular American programs, and the American networks wanted to sell products in the Philippines."

It developed into one of the finest broadcasting institutions in the world. It is now known as the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]]. Sri Lanka created [[broadcasting]] history in Asia when broadcasting was started in Ceylon by the Telegraph Department in 1923 on an experimental footing, just three years after the inauguration of broadcasting in Europe. Gramophone music was broadcast from a tiny room in the Central Telegraph Office with the aid of a small transmitter built by the Telegraph Department engineers from the radio equipment of a captured German submarine.[http://www.flonnet.com/fl2301/stories/20060127001908700.htm For that Old Magic (Frontline Magazine, India)] This broadcasting experiment was successful; barely three years later, on December 16, 1925, a regular broadcasting service came to be instituted. Edward Harper who came to [[Ceylon]] as Chief Engineer of the Telegraph Office in 1921, was the first person to actively promote broadcasting in Ceylon. [[Sri Lanka]] occupies an important place in the history of broadcasting with broadcasting services inaugurated just three years after the launch of the [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom. Edward Harper ([[Edward Harper (engineer)]]) launched the first experimental broadcast as well as founding the Ceylon Wireless Club, together with British and Ceylonese radio enthusiasts on the island. Edward Harper has been dubbed ' the Father of Broadcasting in Ceylon,' because of his pioneering efforts, his skill and his determination to succeed. Edward Harper and his fellow Ceylonese radio enthusiasts, made it happen."

        "text": "The first experimental music broadcasts, from Marconi's ([[Guglielmo Marconi]]) factory in Chelmsford ([[Chelmsford, England]]), began in 1920. Two years later, in October 1922, a consortium of radio manufacturers formed the [[British Broadcasting Company]] (BBC); they allowed some sponsored programs, although they were not what we would today consider a fully commercial station.  Meanwhile, the first radio stations in England were experimental station 2MT, located near Chelmsford, and station 2LO in London:  both were operated by the Marconi Company.  By late 1923, there were six stations broadcasting regularly in the United Kingdom: London's 2LO, Manchester's 2ZY, and stations in Birmingham, Cardiff, Newcastle, and Glasgow.  As for the consortium of radio manufacturers, it dissolved in 1926, when its license expired; it then became the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], a non-commercial organization. Its governors are appointed by the British government, but they do not answer to it. Lord Reith ([[John Charles Walsham Reith]]) took a formative role in developing the BBC, especially in radio.[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jul/07/mediatop100200361 News article on Lord Reith in The Guardian Newspaper, London]  Working as its first manager and Director-General, he promoted the philosophy of ''[[public service broadcasting]]'', firmly grounded in the moral benefits of [[education]] and of uplifting [[entertainment]], eschewing commercial ([[commerce]]) influence and maintaining a maximum of independence from political control."

It was the first station to use a [[vacuum tube]] transmitter to make radio broadcasts on a regular schedule.  From 1912 to 1917 [[Charles Herrold]] made regular broadcasts, but used an [[arc transmitter]]. He switched to a vacuum tube transmitter when he restarted broadcasting activities in 1921. Herrold coined the terms [[broadcasting]] and [[narrowcasting]],.[http://www.dcwstore.com/console-radios-and-tv.htm Radio Broadcasting is Born] Herrold claimed the invention of broadcasting to a wide audience, through the use of antennas designed to radiate signals in all directions. [[David Sarnoff]] has been considered by many as \"the prescient prophet of broadcasting who predicted the medium's rise in 1915\", referring to his radio music box concept."

Many early stations were started by newspapers worried radio might replace their newspapers. 8XK became KDKA ([[KDKA (AM)]]) in 1920. KDKA received the first federal license and began broadcasting on November 2, 1920. Madison Avenue early on recognized the importance of radio as a new advertising medium. Advertising provided the major funding for most stations. The United States never had a licensing fee for set users. The National Broadcasting Company ([[NBC]]) began regular broadcasting in 1926, with telephone links between New York and other Eastern cities.  NBC became the dominant radio network, splitting into Red and Blue networks.  The [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] began in 1927 under the guidance of [[William S. Paley]]."

These lectures were described by the press as a sort of \"wireless college.\"  Soon, other colleges across the U.S. began adding radio broadcasting courses to their curricula; some, like the University of Iowa, even provided what today would be known as distance-learning credits. [[Curry College]], first in Boston and then in Milton, Massachusetts, introduced one of the nation's first broadcasting majors in 1932 when the college teamed up with WLOE in Boston to have students broadcast programs.  This success led to numerous radio courses in the curriculum which has taught thousands of radio broadcasters from the 1930s to today."

Prior to 1927, U.S. radio was supervised by the Department of Commerce.  Then, the Radio Act of 1927 created the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) in 1934, this agency became known as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). A [[Federal Communications Commission]] decision in 1939 required [[NBC]] to divest itself of its [[Blue Network]].  That decision was sustained by the Supreme Court in a 1943 decision, National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, which established the framework that the \"scarcity\" of radio-frequency meant that broadcasting was subject to greater regulation than other media. This [[Blue Network]] network became the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC). Around 1946, ABC, NBC, and CBS began regular television broadcasts. Another TV network, the [[DuMont Television Network]], was founded earlier, but was disbanded in 1956; later in 1986 the surviving DuMont independent stations formed the nucleus of the new [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]."

Apart from extremely limited advertising, this was the broadcasters' only source of income.  From the outset problems with the system came to the fore. Many young people built their own sets, which could receive all the stations."

Canadians were swept up in the radio craze and built crystal sets to listen to American stations while The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada offered its first commercially produced radio-broadcast receiver (Model \"C\") in 1921, followed by its \"Marconiphone\" Model I in 1923. Main themes in the history include the development of the engineering  technology; the construction of stations across the country and the building of networks; the widespread purchase and use of radio and television sets by the general public; debates regarding state versus private ownership of stations; financing of the broadcasts media through the government, license fees, and advertising; the changing content of the programming; the impact of the programming on Canadian identity; the media's influence on shaping audience responses to music, sports and politics; the role of the Québec government; Francophone versus Anglophone cultural tastes; the role of other ethnic groups and First Nations; fears of American cultural imperialism via the airwaves; and the impact of the Internet and smartphones on traditional broadcasting media."

Canadians were swept up in the radio craze and built crystal sets to listen to American stations while The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada offered its first commercially produced radio-broadcast receiver (Model \"C\") in 1921, followed by its \"Marconiphone\" Model I in 1923.
