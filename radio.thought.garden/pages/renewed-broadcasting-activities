In early 1920, de Forest moved the station's transmitter from the Bronx to Manhattan, but did not have permission to do so, so district Radio Inspector [[Arthur Batcheller]] ordered the station off the air. De Forest's response was to return to San Francisco in March, taking 2XG's transmitter with him. A new station, 6XC ([[KZY]]), was established as \"The California Theater station\", which de Forest later stated was the \"first radio-telephone station devoted solely\" to broadcasting to the public."
