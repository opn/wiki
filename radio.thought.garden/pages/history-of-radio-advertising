As of 1901, this \"[[telephone newspaper]]\" was selling twelve-second spots for one florin ([[Hungarian forint]]) each to reach the subscribers listening to the service's programming.",

[[Lee de Forest]] made an arrangement with the Columbia Gramophone record company to broadcast phonograph records from their offices—the phonograph company supplied records in exchange for \"announcing the title and 'Columbia Gramophone Company' with each playing\". The debut program was aired on October 26, 1916 and it was announced that nightly transmissions of news interspersed with Columbia recordings would be sent from de Forest's Highbridge laboratory beginning on November 1. De Forest initially also took advantage of these broadcasts to advertise \"the products of the De Forest Radio Co., mostly the radio parts, with all the zeal of our catalogue and price list\", until comments by Western Electric engineers caused him to eliminate the sales messages. At the time, a commentator in ''QST'' magazine noted that 2XG's efforts showcased the practicality of \"conducting regular advertising and news talks by radio\" which was \"decidedly something to think about\".",

This ban was lifted in October 1919, and some additional promotional record broadcasts took place, including Westinghouse engineer [[Frank Conrad]] over experimental station 8XK, located at his home in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, who provided on-air acknowledgements to the Brunswick Shop in exchange for the store supplying him with recently released records. A more formal example was a late October 1920 broadcast, over the Precision Equipment Company of Cincinnati, Ohio's experimental station, 9XB, that was sponsored by the Randolph Wurlitzer Company, and featured the Victor records that would go on sale in November. However, shortly after radio broadcasting became widely established in the United States in 1922, the record industry became concerned that instead of promoting sales the radio broadcasts were actually suppressing purchases, and these promotional broadcasts ended.",

This provided their customers programming for their purchases, with the sales financing  station operations. But as more stations began operating, station owners were increasingly faced with the issue of how to continue to afford the costs, because operating a radio station became a significant expense, especially when it became the norm to pay performers, and after music publishers successfully argued that they were due royalties for the music the stations played.",

Its primary station, WEAF in New York (now WFAN ([[WFAN (AM)]])), aired its first paid radio commercial on August 28, 1922 for the [[Queensboro Corporation]], advertising a new apartment complex in [[Jackson Heights, Queens]], near the just-completed #7 subway ([[Rapid transit]]) line. Based on a series of industry cross-licensing agreements, AT&T initially claimed that its patent rights gave it a monopoly on commercial radio transmissions. Although the courts upheld this contention, the practice was widely disliked, and AT&T soon came up with a licensing scheme to allow individual stations to begin selling airtime.",

An article in the November 1922 issue of ''Radio Broadcast'' magazine lamented that \"driblets of advertising... are floating through the ether every day\" and expressed concern that \"The woods are full of opportunists who are restrained by no scruples when the scent of profit comes down the wind.\" Even though until the mid-1920s a few stations held out against carrying commercials, no other financing scheme proved practical, and by the late-1920s most U.S. radio stations were carrying commercially-sponsored programs.",

Sanders, advertising director at Shell Oil Co., urged radio broadcasters to deal directly with relevant advertisers, and sell tie-in commercial spots for established radio programs. Like newspaper ads at the time, Sanders figured that advertisers and radio would both benefit from selling ad spots to get the attention of listeners. Radio was an already prominent medium, but Sanders referred to his initiative as radio 'growing up' in terms of its business aspects and how it dealt with advertising. ",
