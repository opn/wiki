Both parties agreed on the need for a national system, and in 1932 set up the Australian Broadcasting Commission, as a government agency that was largely separate from political interference. The first commercial broadcasters, originally known as \"B\" class stations, were on the air as early as 1925. The number of stations (commercial and national) remained relatively dormant throughout World War II and in the post-war era."

Virtually all stations also had programs of interest to women, and children's sessions. From the outset, A Class stations' peak-hour evening programs often consisted of live broadcasts from various [[theatres]], i.e. [[dramas]], [[operas]], [[musicals]], [[variety shows]], [[vaudeville]], etc. The first dramas especially written for radio were transmitted in the mid-1920s. By the 1930s, the ABC was transmitting a number of British programs sourced from the BBC, and commercial stations were receiving a number of US programs, particularly dramas. However, in the 1940s, war-time restrictions made it difficult to access overseas programs and, therefore, the amount of Australian dramatic material increased. As well as using original ideas and scripts, there were a number of local versions of overseas programs. Initially, much of the music broadcast in Australia was from live studio concerts.  However, the amount of gramophone ([[gramophone record]]) (and [[piano roll]]) music soon increased dramatically, particularly on commercial stations."

After World War II the independent Colgate-Palmolive radio production unit was formed. It poached most major radio stars from the various stations. Until the 1950s, the popular image of the whole family seated around a set in the living room was the most accepted way of listening to radio. Therefore, most stations had to be all things to all people, and specialised programming was not really thought about at this stage (it did not come in until the late 1950s). Because of this, programming on most stations was pretty much the same."

They both operated in eras prior to the universal establishment of rural radio stations. 2XT was designed and operated by AWA within the State of [[New South Wales]], from a NSW Railways ([[New South Wales Government Railways]]) train, between November 1925 and December 1927. 2XT, which stood for ''experimental train'', visited over 100 rural centres. Engineers would set up a transmitting aerial and the station would then begin broadcasting.  This led to the further sales of AWA products. 3YB provided a similar service in rural Victoria ([[Victoria (Australia)]]) between October 1931 and November 1935. Initially, the station operated from a Ford ([[Ford Motor Company]]) car and a Ford truck, but from 17 October 1932 they operated from a converted 1899 former Royal Train carriage. Whilst the engineers were setting up the station's 50-watt transmitter in the town being visited, salesmen would sign up advertisers for the fortnight that 3YB would broadcast from that region. The station was on the air from 6.00 and 10.00 pm daily, and its 1,000-record library was divided into set four-hour programs, one for each of 14 days. In other words, the music broadcast from each town was identical. The station was operated by Vic Dinenny, but named after announcer Jack '''Y'''oung from '''B'''allarat. On 18 January 1936, Dinenny set up [[3YB]] [[Warnambool]], followed on 18 May 1937 by 3UL ([[3GG]]) [[Warragul]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>"

The Kanimlba was constructed in Northern Ireland in 1936 and was primarily designed for [[McIlwraith McEachern Limited]] to ply passengers between [[Cairns, Queensland]] and [[Fremantle, Western Australia]]. The broadcasting station was constructed and operated by AWA ([[Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)]]) and was initially given the ham radio ([[Amateur radio]]) callsign VK9MI but was later 9MI. (At this time, the \"9\" in the callsign was aberrationary [see \"Call Signs, above].) The station made an experimental broadcast before leaving Northern Ireland, and a number of such broadcasts at sea, on the way to Australia. 9MI's first official broadcast in April 1939 was made from the [[Great Australian Bight]].<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> The station broadcast on [[short wave]], usually a couple of times per week, but many of its programs were relayed to commercial medium wave stations that were also owned by AWA. The 9MI manager and announcer (and probably the only member of staff) was Eileen Foley. 9MI ceased broadcasting at the commencement of World War II in September 1939. The Kanimbla was commissioned as a [[Royal Navy]] (later [[Royal Australian Navy]]) vessel with the name HMS/HMAS Kanimbla.  It had an extremely prominent and successful war-time career."

Virtually all stations also had programs of interest to women, and children's sessions. From the outset, A Class stations' peak-hour evening programs often consisted of live broadcasts from various [[theatres]], i.e. [[dramas]], [[operas]], [[musicals]], [[variety shows]], [[vaudeville]], etc. The first dramas especially written for radio were transmitted in the mid-1920s. By the 1930s, the ABC was transmitting a number of British programs sourced from the BBC, and commercial stations were receiving a number of US programs, particularly dramas. However, in the 1940s, war-time restrictions made it difficult to access overseas programs and, therefore, the amount of Australian dramatic material increased. As well as using original ideas and scripts, there were a number of local versions of overseas programs. Initially, much of the music broadcast in Australia was from live studio concerts.  However, the amount of gramophone ([[gramophone record]]) (and [[piano roll]]) music soon increased dramatically, particularly on commercial stations."

After World War II the independent Colgate-Palmolive radio production unit was formed. It poached most major radio stars from the various stations. Until the 1950s, the popular image of the whole family seated around a set in the living room was the most accepted way of listening to radio. Therefore, most stations had to be all things to all people, and specialised programming was not really thought about at this stage (it did not come in until the late 1950s). Because of this, programming on most stations was pretty much the same."

        "text": "Two of Australia's most unusual medium wave stations were mobile stations 2XT and 3YB. They both operated in eras prior to the universal establishment of rural radio stations. 2XT was designed and operated by AWA within the State of [[New South Wales]], from a NSW Railways ([[New South Wales Government Railways]]) train, between November 1925 and December 1927. 2XT, which stood for ''experimental train'', visited over 100 rural centres. Engineers would set up a transmitting aerial and the station would then begin broadcasting.  This led to the further sales of AWA products. 3YB provided a similar service in rural Victoria ([[Victoria (Australia)]]) between October 1931 and November 1935. Initially, the station operated from a Ford ([[Ford Motor Company]]) car and a Ford truck, but from 17 October 1932 they operated from a converted 1899 former Royal Train carriage. Whilst the engineers were setting up the station's 50-watt transmitter in the town being visited, salesmen would sign up advertisers for the fortnight that 3YB would broadcast from that region. The station was on the air from 6.00 and 10.00 pm daily, and its 1,000-record library was divided into set four-hour programs, one for each of 14 days. In other words, the music broadcast from each town was identical. The station was operated by Vic Dinenny, but named after announcer Jack '''Y'''oung from '''B'''allarat. On 18 January 1936, Dinenny set up [[3YB]] [[Warnambool]], followed on 18 May 1937 by 3UL ([[3GG]]) [[Warragul]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>"

        "text": "The [[merchant vessel]] MV Kanimbla ([[HMAS Kanimbla (C78)]]) is believed to be the world's only ship built with an inbuilt broadcasting station. The Kanimlba was constructed in Northern Ireland in 1936 and was primarily designed for [[McIlwraith McEachern Limited]] to ply passengers between [[Cairns, Queensland]] and [[Fremantle, Western Australia]]. The broadcasting station was constructed and operated by AWA ([[Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)]]) and was initially given the ham radio ([[Amateur radio]]) callsign VK9MI but was later 9MI. (At this time, the \"9\" in the callsign was aberrationary [see \"Call Signs, above].) The station made an experimental broadcast before leaving Northern Ireland, and a number of such broadcasts at sea, on the way to Australia. 9MI's first official broadcast in April 1939 was made from the [[Great Australian Bight]].<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> The station broadcast on [[short wave]], usually a couple of times per week, but many of its programs were relayed to commercial medium wave stations that were also owned by AWA. The 9MI manager and announcer (and probably the only member of staff) was Eileen Foley. 9MI ceased broadcasting at the commencement of World War II in September 1939. The Kanimbla was commissioned as a [[Royal Navy]] (later [[Royal Australian Navy]]) vessel with the name HMS/HMAS Kanimbla.  It had an extremely prominent and successful war-time career."
