De Forest's first entertainment broadcast occurred in February 1907, when he transmitted electronic [[telharmonium]] music from his laboratory station in New York City. This was followed by tests that included, in the fall, Eugenia Farrar singing \"I Love You Truly\". (Beginning in 1904, the U.S. Navy had broadcast daily time signals and weather reports, but these employed spark transmitters, transmitting in Morse code)."

        "text": "The first widely publicized information about Fessenden's early broadcasts did not appear until 1932, when an article prepared by former Fessenden associate Samuel M. Kintner, \"Pittsburgh's Contributions to Radio\", appeared in the December 1932 issue of ''The Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers''. This reviewed information included in a January 29, 1932 letter sent by Fessenden to Kintner. (Fessenden subsequently died five months before Kintner's article appeared). In this account, Fessenden reported that on the evening of December 24, 1906 ([[Christmas Eve]]), he had made the first of two radio broadcasts of music and entertainment to a general audience, using the alternator-transmitter at Brant Rock. Fessenden remembered producing a short program that included a phonograph record of [[Ombra mai fu]] (Largo) by [[George Frideric Handel]], followed by Fessenden playing [[Adolphe Adam]]'s carol ''[[O Holy Night]]'' on the violin and singing ''Adore and be Still'' by [[Gounod]], and closing with a biblical passage: \"Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to men of good will\" (Luke ([[Gospel of Luke]]) 2:14). He also stated that a second short program was broadcast on December 31 ([[New Year's Eve]]). The intended audience for both of these transmissions was primarily shipboard radio operators along the Atlantic seaboard. Fessenden claimed that the two programs had been widely publicized in advance, and the Christmas Eve broadcast had been heard \"as far down\" as [[Norfolk, Virginia]], while the New Year Eve's broadcast had reached listeners in the [[West Indies]]."

There was general consensus in the centennial discussions that Fessenden had the technical means to make broadcasts, given the widespread reports about the success of the December 21 alternator-transmitter demonstrations. However, because of the station's very low power, even if the broadcasts had taken place it was questionable if the range could have matched Fessenden's claim of being heard hundreds of kilometers away."

In a 1908 comprehensive review of \"Wireless Telephony\", he included a section titled \"possibilities\" that listed promising radio telephone uses. Neither the main article, nor this list, makes any reference to broadcasting, instead only noting conventional applications of point-to-point communication, enumerated as \"local exchanges\", \"long-distance lines\", \"transmarine transmission\", \"wireless telephony from ship to ship\", and \"wireless telephone from ship to local exchange\"."
