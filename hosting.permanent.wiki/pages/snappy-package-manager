The packages, called 'snaps' and the tool for using them 'snapd', work across a range of Linux distributions and allow therefore distro-agnostic upstream software deployment. The system is designed to work for phone, cloud, internet of things and desktop computing - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snappy_(package_manager) wikipedia]"
