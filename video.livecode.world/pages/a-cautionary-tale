Curtis tells the story of how a [[card counter]] named Jess Marcum was recruited by [[Donald Trump]] to analyse the gambling habits of [[Akio Kashiwagi]] at his casino, the [[Trump Taj Mahal]], in [[Atlantic City]], after Trump had lost millions of dollars to Kashiwagi. In an effort to avert the impending bankruptcy of the casino, Marcum devised a model that predicted a way of recouping the money from Kashiwagi, who lost US$10&nbsp;million. However, before he could pay, he was killed by [[yakuza]] gangsters, and the casino went bankrupt, with Trump having to sell many of his assets to the banks."
