In the film, Curtis argues that since the 1970s, governments, financiers, and technological utopians have given up on the complex \"real world\" and built a simple \"fake world\" that is run by corporations and kept stable by politicians.

Barlow, who had been part of the LSD ([[Lysergic acid diethylamide]]) (also known as \"acid\") counterculture in the 1960s and founded the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], wrote a manifesto called [[A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace]]. Addressed to politicians, it declared \"the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose upon us\".

The method, called [[perception management]], aimed to distract people from the complexities of the real world. American politics are described as having become increasingly detached from reality. Curtis uses the collapse of the Soviet Union ([[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]]) at the end of the 1980s as an example of an event that took the West ([[Western Bloc]]) by surprise because reality had become less and less important. A [[Jane Fonda]] workout video is shown to illustrate that [[socialists]] had given up trying to change the real world and were instead focusing on the self and encouraging others to do the same. The video is intercut with footage of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] and his wife, Elena ([[Elena Ceaușescu]]), being executed by firing squad and buried following the [[Romanian Revolution]] in 1989."
