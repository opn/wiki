It is stated that \"every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system\". That is, any regulator that is maximally successful and simple must be isomorphic with the system being regulated. This result is obtained by considering the entropy of the variation of the output of the controlled system, and shows that, under very general conditions, that the entropy is minimized when there is a mapping from the states of the system to the states of the regulator. The minimum is obtained when the map is an isomorphism, that is, when the regulator models the system - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_regulator wikipedia]",
