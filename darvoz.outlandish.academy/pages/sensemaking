While this process has been studied by other disciplines under other names for centuries, the term \"sensemaking\" has primarily marked three distinct but related research areas since the 1970s: Sensemaking was introduced to humanâ€“computer interaction by PARC researchers Russell, Stefik, Pirolli and Card in 1993, to information science by Brenda Dervin, and to organizational studies by Karl E. Weick - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensemaking wikipedia]"

      "text": "In information science the term is most often written as \"sense-making.\" In both cases, the concept has been used to bring together insights drawn from philosophy, sociology, and cognitive science (especially social psychology). Sensemaking research is therefore often presented as an interdisciplinary research programme."
