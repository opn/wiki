These features are demurrage or negative interest rates, bonus and malus conversion systems, as well as whether\nto require, allow or forbid the conversion of the currency into other currencies, mainly national legal tender.\n                                108 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 109\nPART02 C/05\nDemurrage\nDemurrage, in the complementary currency domain, is a built-\nin reduction over time of the nominal value of a currency. This discourages hoarding and incentivises spending by essentially levying a tax on currency holders. Ideally, demurrage should involve a charge of a simple negative interest, applied as regularly as practical. While this is easily done on a daily basis with electronic currencies, for paper currencies longer intervals may be necessary. In such cases, demurrage can be achieved by requiring the regular (monthly or quarterly) purchase of stamps that need to be put on the notes to maintain them valid at face value. With the value of the currency otherwise going down over time, it is in holders’ interest to spend as quickly as possible, or before the next stamp is due.\nNot every form of money is equally suitable for demurrage. Organising demurrage in electronic money is fairly easy, requiring only the application of simple bookkeeping techniques. However, as well as the potential benefits outlined above, demurrage has some drawbacks, which should be considered when deciding whether to incorporate this feature into the currency design.\nTable 4: Pros and cons of demurrage\nBonus/malus\n         Bonus and malus in action\nUntil 31 December 2013 the Brixton Pound had a bonus of\n10% for those who exchanged their pounds sterling into the local currency, meaning that £100 of national currency would buy B£110. Once in circulation the exchange rate between Brixton Pound and pound sterling remains at one-to-one: the bonus functioned as an encouragement to convert to and use the local currency. It also had\na malus of 10% for those businesses who exchanged their Brixton Pounds into pound sterling. The malus functioned as a disincentive to convert and an incentive to find local suppliers to spend the Brixton Pounds with.\nWithin the community currency world, the term bonus refers to a premium paid to those who exchange legal tender for a community currency. Typically, bonuses take the form of a gift, issued in the community currency, added on top of the amount exchanged. Bonuses act as incentives to attract new users or to retain existing ones. Malus is the opposite of bonus – typically a charge on the conversion back into legal tender – and is a straightforward way of financing the bonus system.\nTable 5: Pros and cons of a bonus and malus\n                                                                 Pros\n   Cons\n   Demurrage\n     Creates a clear disincentive against hoarding\nEmphasises currency’s main function: medium of exchange\nNudges consumers to spend before having to pay fee\nEnhances the velocity of circulation\n        Many people do not fully understand the concept\nPuts collective benefits over personal preference\nGoes against the common assumption about money – ‘you gain money by keeping it’\nComplicated in theory and practice, can keep businesses and individuals from joining\n              Pros\n   Cons\n   Bonus/Malus\n     Bonuses can encourage users to sign up to the currency\nIncentivises the purchase of more community currency\nIncentivises businesses to find spending options for the currency they receive instead of changing back to national currency\nCan generate income for the currency project or charitable causes\n     Businesses are discouraged from joining by the cost of conversion\nAdds a layer of complexity to understanding the operation\nBonus can make the currency look like a commercial scheme\nPublic sector partners might not be able to accept the malus and not participate in the currency\n            110 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 111\nPART02 C/05\nConvertibility to national currency\nWhether or not to make a community currency convertible into another currency, usually the national currency, is an essential question during the design phase. The decision will have major ramifications for the whole system, from the issuance process to the detailed legal requirements that convertible currencies have to follow.\nThe spectrum on which currencies sit can be illustrated by looking at how Brixton, Bitcoin and the WIR handle conversion of their currencies. At one end is the Brixton Pound, which states within the rules of the currency that all users and businesses may at any point convert any Brixton Pounds that they have in their possession at par for pound sterling.\nAt the other end is the WIR in Switzerland. Under the terms and conditions of the currency, exchange for Swiss francs, or any other currency, is not permitted. This is clearly stated in the agreement signed by all members and infringement can lead to exclusion from\nthe WIR network. However, despite the prohibition and potential consequences in place, numerous users convert WIR francs into Swiss francs over the counter or though third-party platforms, usually for considerably less than their nominal parity of value.\nBitcoin inhabits the middle ground, leaving convertibility purely up to market demand. Many companies and trading platforms offer to convert legal tender into Bitcoin and vice versa. Interestingly the fact that conversion is not specifically prohibited means that regulators treat it as convertible and are starting to regulate Bitcoin exchanges rather than the Bitcoin currency itself.\nTable 6: Pros and cons of convertibility and non-convertibility\n      Pro\n   Con\n   Convertible\n    Guaranteed conversion can\nhelp businesses and users feel comfortable getting into the system\nAllows businesses to participate even if their suppliers are not part of the network\nAllowing conversion opens the possibility of generating revenue\n Requires the maintenance of funds to meet conversion liability\nRequires compliance to financial system regulations\nReduces the incentive, especially for businesses, to find creative ways to spend the currency or to encourage others in their supply chain to join the currency network\n   Not convertible\n      No legal tender reserves are required\nClosed-loop, non-convertible currencies operate outside financial regulation\n            Users and businesses can be more reticent to join such systems, especially if spending options are limited\nRequires active management of the volume of money being created to ensure that it grows in line with spending volumes"
