With mainstream money, such as the national or transnational currencies we use every day, these objectives are obscured – precisely because, paradoxically, the medium and usage is so familiar and unremarkable.",

Indeed, this conception has been increasingly challenged by critical economists, who identify negative economic, environmental and societal consequences from how conventional monetary systems are designed and managed.",

      "text": "From their earliest incarnations to most contemporary systems, currencies can be thought of as records of transactions. Whereas previously these records were stored on tablets and then books, today most are kept electronically, in a purely digital form. In fact, new communication technologies are widely predicted to herald the ‘end of cash’. In place of handing over a piece of paper or a coin as a record of exchange, computers can now tally transactions much more efficiently.",

Indeed, many aspects of money today already seem in a state of transformation not dissimilar to the overhaul of transportation and production when steam power sparked the industrial revolution. These profound changes bring both great risks and exciting opportunities to reconsider and redesign money to better serve human society and our natural environment.",
