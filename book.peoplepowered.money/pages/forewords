      "text": "Just as fish do not see the water that they swim in, so we exist every day in a world where money is shaping and controlling our lives and yet we take it entirely for granted. We do not ask who created that money; or why some people come by it so easily whereas others are always running to catch up. That is a shame, because the design and issue of money is one of the keys to understanding economic injustice, and emancipating ourselves from the debt-based money system is an essential step towards creating a just and sustainable world.",

With support from the European Union, [[Community Currencies in Action]] (CCIA) is the biggest transnational coalition working towards building a stronger theoretical and practice base for the development of local currency initiatives.",

The idea of a community currency is no longer a marginal one and the time is right for these initiatives to move into the mainstream.",

I am proud to have one of the most successful local currencies – the [[Bristol Pound]] – in my political patch. This book will help to share the understanding of that and the other currencies that are liberating many from economic oppression and helping them build vibrant and resilient economies.",

These vary considerably, and include digital currency technologies such as [[Bitcoin]], new modes of social lending such as [[Zopa]], innovative mobile payment systems such as the [[M-Pesa]], and community currencies such as the [[SoNantes]] in France, the [[Makkie]] in the Netherlands and the [[Brixton Pound]] in the UK.",

In many ways this is a return to the past: multiple monies were a fact of life until the late 19th century, and have remained so outside the global north, although in terms of scale, diversity and technology, what we are seeing now is also quite new.",

But as exciting and intriguing as these developments are, they also pose urgent questions: how best to understand the nature of money in an era of monetary pluralism; how to evaluate the efficacy of new monetary forms; what kind of regulation (if any) might be called for by their emergence; and what their implications will be for our everyday lives.",
