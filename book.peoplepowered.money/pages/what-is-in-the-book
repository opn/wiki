      "text": "Chapter 2 then turns to the objectives of community currencies and emphasises the importance of an outcomes-led approach to their design. We focus on four areas of impact that currencies often address: raising the quality of public services; supporting small businesses and the local economy; addressing social inclusion and building social fabric; and improving environmental sustainability.",

      "text": "Chapter 3 gives an overview of the kinds of stakeholders community currency projects typically engage with, and what levels of commitment and contribution can be expected from each. Some of the challenges associated with undertaking such a large, complex and multi-partner project are also discussed.\nFrom here, Part Two moves on to consider the ‘nuts and bolts’ of currency design, delivery and implementation. Although this section is necessarily more technical, we hope that the material will be equally valuable and accessible to both unfamiliar and specialist readers.",

A currency can be fantastic ‘on paper’ – so to speak – but without a sound organisational structure or secure funding channels, it can be difficult to get off the ground.",

For both individual community currencies and the field as a whole, it is essential to build up a rigorous body of evidence in order to learn what works and what doesn’t, which design features are effective – or ineffective – in different circumstances and how projects can be further refined and improved.",
