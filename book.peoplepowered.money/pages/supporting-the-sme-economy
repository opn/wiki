High streets containing a diverse mix of businesses form local economies more resilient to external changes and more rewarding for residents and visitors. Increasingly, these businesses are meeting the growing consumer preference for online shopping, forming what some have termed ‘virtual high streets’ of independent businesses to counter the current online big hitters such as Amazon and supermarkets’ websites.\nThis desired state of commercial diversity is threatened by the mainstream growth model of the retail sector, which tends to follow the logic of ‘bigger is better’.

Some business-focused currencies assist businesses with operational aspects, such as purchasing supplies, incentivising sales and paying staff, helping them to improve productivity and become more resilient to changes in the wider economy. The target users of different models vary, with some business-to-business currencies aimed solely at SMEs and others extending to consumers.\nImproving cash flow\nMany European financial sectors, the UK’s being a prime example, are dominated by a handful of international commercial banks. Because of this, they are easily criticised for being out of touch with the productive industries and SMEs that power regional and local economies. Since the 2008 financial crisis, banks have generally reduced lending to SMEs, leaving many businesses and start-ups in need of alternative credit sources.\nComplementary currency initiatives can help SMEs support each other financially by lending and receiving credit, goods and\n                                                                           048 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 049\nPART 01 C/02\nservices within the currency network – reducing reliance on cash and banks. For example, business-to-business (b2b) trade systems allow members to make purchases and sales using ‘trade credits’ or ‘points’, so they can reserve more of their regular cash flow for operational costs.\nTradeQoin\nTradeQoin is a Dutch SME trading network that lets businesses pay each other for goods and services with their own digital currency created at the moment of exchange. This helps members reduce their euro expenditure and offers SMEs fast and cheap working capital\nin TradeQoin. The online marketplace run by members stimulates business between participating SMEs.\nComplementary currency systems have historically emerged as substitutes for mainstream money when there is not enough of the latter circulating. This can come in the form of increasing business cash flow, as has been discussed, but also as a replacement transaction medium when the regular option, for example the national currency, has dried up.\nBangla-Pesa\nAs a mutual-credit system for SMEs in an impoverished district of Mombasa, Kenya, the Bangla-Pesa allows members to trade goods and services with one another regardless of their conventional money supply.\nOver 200 SMEs are currently part of the network, which itself is only one facet of a wider poverty-reduction programme. The currency was introduced by Koru Kenya, a local NGO working on economic relief and stabilisation.\nAs 75% of the SMEs in the area are owned by women, the Bangla- Pesa is also proving to be a useful tool for reducing both gender and economic inequalities. According to research carried out in 2014, the ‘typical’ network member is a 35-year-old mother who identifies herself as the main provider for 2-3 children.7\nCreating strong business networks\nMany currency schemes offer businesses an opportunity to form networks between themselves, providing a platform to publicise\ntheir work to the rest of the network. This can generate incremental sales from buyers looking for trade opportunities from within the currency network. Businesses can identify with one another over the ethical dimension in the trade they perform, or simply recognise the commercial advantage of increasing mutual exchanges. Currency networks can connect businesses with new customers sharing values such as reducing carbon footprints, or keeping production local.\nBerkshares\nBerkShares are the community currency of the Berkshire region of Massachusetts, USA.\nThe currency is purchased in return for US dollars at local partner banks, with an estimated 4.3 million BerkShares issued since 2006 and around 130,000 in circulation at any one time. The principle objective of the BerkShare, like other geographically bound currencies, is to keep wealth within the area and encourage localisation of production and consumption.\nFurthermore, strong business networks encourage a self-help model of exchange and mutual support along supply chains. Through facilitating interactions between businesses, they encourage long- term relationships between SMEs in the same area or sector. This could be, for example, through building links between a service provider, such as a restaurant, and local suppliers, such as cash-and- carry or drinks companies.\nPalmas\nBanco Palmas is a community bank in Fortaleza, Brazil. Since 2000, it has offered interest-free microcredit loans in the local currency, the Palmas. The bank’s objective is to localise production and consumption and, through the Palmas, retain more wealth within the area, generating both employment and income. Banco Palmas illustrates the benefits of a strong local banking sector for local economies, acting as a trusted backer of the community currency.\nThe example has now spread to over 100 locations across Brazil, and is acknowledged by the central bank as a valuable initiative.\n                                                   050 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 051\nPART 01 C/02\nUsing spare capacity\nMost businesses do not operate at 100% of potential capacity. The commercial benefits of connecting underused assets with unmet needs – a primary goal of complementary currencies – are clear.\nA reward currency scheme might enable businesses to exchange particular assets at reduced cost to loyal customers for points; or a trade network could provide otherwise underused services to other businesses in exchange for credit. For instance, spare cinema seats could be offered as competition prize or staff bonuses to another business, in exchange for credits. These credits can then be spent elsewhere in the network.\nTradeQoin case study\nManoushka Botts, founder of Amsterdam-based CarCleaners.nl, is a TradeQoin member. Speaking of the benefits, Manoushka says:\n“We have a number of cleaners on contract and during low season they have less work to do. I decided to start offering cleaning services in exchange for TradeQoin credit, which I can then spend on something I need for the business. What I’m looking for is a company or freelancer to help me develop a new website.”\nThe TradeQoin network not only provides Manoushka with another source of income, but connects her to other local SMEs, supporting the area’s economy overall.\nKeeping money circulating locally\nPumping money into an area is pointless if it flows straight back out again. Yet this is precisely what happens with national or (regarding the euro) international currency. This leakage occurs because, if high streets are dominated by multinational corporations with non-local supply chains and there is no geographical restriction on where the currency can be spent, profits will not remain within the locality.\n“The SoNantes benefits those who produce and consume locally. It doesn’t replace the euro, but provides an intelligent complement.

It gives each of us a new way to act for our region, for its development and for our jobs.

They can help to plug the leaks – reducing the level of profits flowing to headquarters of large corporations, rather than back to the people that work for them.8 Why does this matter?

The currency incorporates demurrage, or negative interest: in order for Chiemgauer notes to remain valid at face value, a token must be purchased and attached every three months. This incentivises spending and discourages hoarding, meaning that the Chiemgauer circulates more rapidly and frequently than the euro. The 600 SMEs in the network meet around 50%\nof local people’s needs. Around 2500 users and 250 voluntary organisations also use the Chiemgauer.\nEusko\nThe Eusko is a regional currency launched in 2013 in Bayonne, a city in the French Basque Country. As of October 2013, it is the largest complementary currency in France, with more than 466 business members, 2,300 individual users and 170,000 Euskos in circulation.\nThe Eusko aims to relocalise the economy through encouraging local trade; develop social ties and solidarity; better value the Basque language and culture; support local projects of common interest; and reduce the environmental impacts of the economy.\nThe Eusko is backed and valued one-to-one with the euro.\nIf a certain critical mass of businesses and individuals using\na community currency is reached, then a mutually reinforcing relationship between benefits to local buyers and sellers should develop. As more local SMEs accept the currency, more individuals are encouraged to shop with them; local businesses then recycle community currency profits back through, for example, exchanges with other SMEs and bonuses to staff – using money that can then only be spent once more back in the local economy. A virtuous circle of spending and reinvestment is thereby created.\nWith production and supply currently so globalised, this ideal state is unlikely to be realised immediately. Community currency practitioners therefore actively identify and fill gaps in the local economy. One way to do this is to use national currency surplus – built up as individuals and businesses buy the local currency without redeeming it later – to make interest-free loans to sustainable local businesses that meet supply and production needs and gradually build a local economy that is both commercially and environmentally sustainable – and avoids leakage.\nEKO\nThe EKO is the community currency of the Findhorn ecovillage in north-west Scotland. Pegged to pound sterling, it operates alongside the village’s LETS to provide a strong and resilient local money system.\nThe EKO offers low-interest loans to various community projects. To date, these have included a youth project, a local co-operative and a community wind farm. A sustainable housing development will also soon be financed through the EKO. The currency contributes\nto the ecovillage’s overall vision of demonstrating an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable community-based development model.\nEducate consumers and increase customer loyalty\nCurrency projects can stimulate thinking and discussion about how money works and impacts a local economy. Raising people’s awareness of the socio-economic dimensions of their consumer behaviour can have direct benefits for local economies through increasing custom to participating businesses. As customers chat to business owners about why they’re participating in a community currency scheme, and what advantages it brings to both parties, stronger connections between local people and businesses are forged. This can create a more social high street, where business owners and customers get to know each other, as well as developing customer loyalty around the shared values represented by the currency. Both aspects can boost or stabilise the turnover of participating SMEs, as customers seek out participating businesses to spend their local money.\n                                               054 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 055\nPART 01 C/02\nLocal authorities, as major procurers of services and products, may be receptive to the benefits of community currencies. For instance, using a community currency to procure services is an active way to demonstrate support for independent businesses.\nBrixton Pound\nThe Brixton Pound is a community currency operating in South London, UK. Although primarily designed to support local SMEs, the Brixton Pound also seeks to increase the sense of community cohesion and draw on the area’s history of social activism.\nValued one-to-one against pound sterling, the Brixton Pound can only be spent with local SMEs and thereby aims to retain wealth within the community. Many participating businesses offer discounts to those paying in Brixton Pounds – in effect offering a loyalty scheme that both demonstrates their commitment to the local economy and increases custom. In the long term, increased links between Brixton-based SMEs themselves localise as far as possible supply and production chains to create a more sustainable and resilient economy for the area.\nThe Brixton Pound has demonstrated commitment to supporting independent businesses through vocal opposition to plans that\nwould see many well-known local establishments evicted from one\nof Brixton’s famous high streets: Atlantic Road. The high profile of\nthe Brixton Pound helped the campaign gain media attention and draw 13,000 signatures on a petition protesting the evictions (the campaign was ongoing at the time of writing). This demonstrates how currency initiatives can situate themselves within wider communal, social and political life and the benefits they can bring to an area beyond monetary value.\nSocial highstreet case study\nResearch from the University of Bristol and Brunel University, London, provides evidence that community currencies primarily designed to support the SME economy may also have significant social effects. According to the research, transactions using\nsuch currencies – in this case the Bristol Pound – contribute to people making connections to others, to their communities, to the\nenvironments they move through and to what they consume, while developing feelings of trust and opening up new kinds of interaction. In other words, the conscious choice of businesses and consumers to conduct economic exchanges via a medium that explicitly values and supports the local area and SMEs can lead to significant gains in community cohesion and reconfigure social relations.9\nOffer businesses and their customers new ways to transact\nCurrencies can provide businesses with point-of-sale options that they might not otherwise have been able to afford. A currency initiative incorporating digital systems, such as phone apps or pay-by-text options, allows participating traders to accept electronic payments – and offers customers new, often more convenient ways to purchase goods. Small businesses can thereby keep up with – or even move ahead of – the technology offered by large corporations, while the added convenience for customers can translate into a boost in sales.\nBrixton Pound case study\nBrixton Pound has pioneered new payment options for local traders. When the Brixton Pound launched their pay-by-text system, the added convenience prompted Alicia Reynolds – a Senior HR Officer at Lambeth Council – to request part of her salary in her local currency. In her words:\n“It saves me a trip to the bank. Sometimes I’ll go shopping, and then remember I don’t have any cash on me, but then I realise, I’ve got my Brixton Pounds. Paying by text means you don’t have to queue up and wait for change.”\nThe success of pay-by-text spurred on a further advancement\nin 2014 – the introduction of ‘tap and pay’ technology with a corresponding app. The new system uses near-field communication (NFC) technology, which allows smartphones and similar devices to make radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them into proximity.\nEvaluation of the Brixton Pound highlights the potential of community currencies to impact behaviour and affect attitudes. Of those using the currency, 70% reported that they had got to know local business owners better as a result, 55% that it had made shopping more convenient, 88% that it was good to be spending in a way that supported local values, and 82% that it had reinforced their pride in Brixton.10\n                                            056 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 057\nPART 01 C/02\nCountering inequality and social exclusion\nThe day-to-day costs of active involvement in local voluntary or leisure activities are often overlooked. On top of major household costs like rent, bills or mortgage payments, the cost of, for example, taking a bus to another part of town, or paying a child minder, often prohibits people on low incomes from participation in local events. Volunteering at a primary school or helping to run a coffee morning involves time and money that not everyone has. By redistributing resources more equally, community currencies can help to overcome these inequalities of free time and money.\nSocial participation\nExclusion of certain groups from social life weakens community relationships overall. Specially designed currencies can be used to oil the wheels of social participation, ensuring that all groups are given realistic, relevant and meaningful opportunities to get involved in their communities.\nSpice Time Credits\nSpice partners with local authorities, schools and housing associations to offer time-credits to individuals participating in voluntary programmes. Credits can then be traded between individual members – as in a traditional timebank – or spent at various non- profit, public or corporate partners. These currently include cinemas, gyms, family activities and vocational training. Spice also works with the public sector, utilising time-credits to introduce co-production to public services.\nAt both the earning and spending stages, one credit equals one hour of a person’s time or organisation’s services. The Spice system has its historical roots in the Welsh labour movement, when mining communities would contribute part of their wage to both support and access mutually owned local services, such as clinics, workingmen’s clubs and libraries.\nIt is important to clarify that community currencies cannot single-handedly overcome the deep social, economic and political inequalities that exist within societies. These are structural issues requiring structural change. Nonetheless, well-designed currencies offer a unique tool for addressing some of the drivers and effects of social exclusion.\nInvolvement in voluntary and community work offers many benefits to the socially excluded and economically marginalised: a chance\nto develop new relationships, valuable skills and a feeling of self-\nworth. The work of such projects is also of great worth to the wider community, mobilising local residents’ latent assets and skills. For example, credit-earning sessions allowing qualified but unemployed hairdressers to practise their skills and build up their haircutting experience also facilitate socialising. In this way, currency transactions can catalyse further community activity, as people think up new earning and spending opportunities for the currency system and form new relationships with local facilities, both private and public.\n                                                    058 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 059\nPART 01 C/02\n“The most exciting thing about time-credits is their diversity\nof applications. They can work with schools, social care, community connection, building social capacity. It can work whether you’re a small or big organisation. They really allow us to improve our interventions.”\nClaire Mattison, Lancashire County Council, discussing Spice Time Credits\nMoreover, the activities created through currency schemes give people extra incentives to engage with others in their area. If well designed, they can bring together a diverse range of groups: people from different generations, cultures, religions or social classes whose paths might not otherwise cross.\nMakkie case study\nThe time-based Makkie amplifies the impact of around 250 community projects in East Amsterdam. A founder of a community transport service that uses the Makkie explains:\n“Just going to the local market, to the hospital or to visit someone – those are the type of trips that pose a problem for the elderly. A taxi is too expensive and you have to order a ride with Connexxion [the local public transport company that offers trips for disabled and elderly] way in advance. Just getting dropped off for a\nsmall errand at the supermarket is impossible.”\nNow, she offers neighbourhood lifts in exchange for one Makkie. As\na result, elderly residents are no longer house-bound and can travel safely to wherever they need to go – having a good chat on the way.\nSupporting the core economy\nThe networks and relationships of trust within a community form the basis of social life and nurture the ground from which the formal economy of money and markets grows. However, as forms of unpaid work, the value of caring for relatives, raising children, assisting neighbours or carrying out household tasks like cooking, cleaning and managing finances, is generally not recognised in the formal economy. These ongoing tasks of maintaining and fuelling society and the lives that make it up, often but not exclusively carried out by women, constitute the ‘core economy’ – without which life as we know it would grind to a halt.\nMuch can be done to tap into, and strengthen, the core economy, as well as to better value and support it. Valuing here signifies the recognition of worth, of what this economy contributes and achieves, rather than putting a specific price on it. This is where community currencies can play a role.\nCurrencies based on time-exchanges explicitly recognise the skills of those making up the core economy. For instance, in a time-credit system, a neighbour providing respite care for a local carer can be rewarded for their time with a credit. This credit could then be redeemed for a school trip for their child or a trip to the local cinema. The idea is not to give volunteers a form of payment, as the activities themselves tend to be considered intrinsically valuable – in other words carrying them out is a reward in itself. Instead, time-credits are a recognition of the time spent in and for the wider community. They allow those carrying out this work to take up opportunities that might otherwise be inaccessible, or even donate their earned credits to local charities or vulnerable individuals.\nAddressing inequalities\nIn any given society, certain groups are more powerful and better-off financially than others. Social policies that aim to enhance or ‘grow’ the core economy must therefore go hand-in-hand with measures to promote greater equality within and between different\n                            060 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 061\nPART 01 C/02\n social groups. A systemic approach understands the dynamics\nof inequality: what the causes are and how they interact with and reinforce each other. Social and cultural factors such as gender,\nage, disability, ethnicity and sexual orientation influence the way people experience income and wealth inequality and often intensify disadvantages. Addressing complex systems of inequalities – both in economic and social terms – therefore requires specific strategies.\nCommunity currencies cannot be expected to tackle these inequalities alone, but they do offer a valuable tool. Crucial to reducing inequality of any type is empowerment. Community currencies can help redistribute power from those who already have it, through wealth or other forms of privilege, to those who don’t.\nSpice Time Credits case study\nCheryl Hughes first earned Ely Time Credits through participating in community projects, getting her whole family involved to earn enough for an upcoming day trip. Participating in these activities helped Cheryl build new relationships and get to know new people locally. She then formed a new group herself: Community Mothers. Cheryl says:\n“Time Credits opened my eyes. I never thought I would be able to do anything other than care for my children because of my dyslexia. It’s helped me gain confidence in myself and improve the way I now live my life.”\nEmpowerment and self-worth come hand in hand, and timebanks and time-based currencies that value a diverse range of skills and knowledge allow both to grow. The voluntary activities facilitated by a currency system enable participants to gain new experiences that offer intrinsic rewards, such as feelings of pride, but are also extrinsically valuable, as the skills they involve are widely applicable in the worlds of paid work and formal education. In this way, currency projects can directly address inequalities\nof learning, training and employability by putting those with less opportunity to gain the types of skills sought by employers on a more even footing with those who enjoy a more privileged status.\nImproving individual wellbeing and health\nMost people would agree that a successful society is one where economic activity delivers high levels of sustainable wellbeing for\nits citizens. In this context, wellbeing considers how people feel and function, and how they evaluate their lives. By providing opportunities for social contact and enhancing self-esteem, community currencies can contribute significantly to improving personal wellbeing.\nSuch projects offer avenues for socialisation and skill-learning to groups who, to varying degrees, may be excluded from the world of work. In these ways currency schemes can help reduce inequalities arising from high demands on service-provision in low-income areas – a strain that might arise because families with lower incomes have fewer resources to meet their own needs. Higher levels of wellbeing are often associated with positive outcomes such as improved physical health.\nFeeling better\nIndependent evaluation of time-credit schemes run by Spice shows that participants feel fitter, report fewer health problems and visit GPs less often. In 2014, independent impact assessment of Spice found that:\nz 65%ofusersreportedagenerallyimprovedqualityoflife z 45%reportedfeelinghealthier\nz 19%reportedgoingtothedoctorlessfrequently\nThese health benefits are likely knock-on effects of significantly increased levels of community engagement, which helps individuals to feel socially valued and empowered.11\n"

The bank’s objective is to localise production and consumption and, through the Palmas, retain more wealth within the area, generating both employment and income. Banco Palmas illustrates the benefits of a strong local banking sector for local economies, acting as a trusted backer of the community currency.\nThe example has now spread to over 100 locations across Brazil, and is acknowledged by the central bank as a valuable initiative.\n                                                   050 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 051\nPART 01 C/02\nUsing spare capacity\nMost businesses do not operate at 100% of potential capacity. The commercial benefits of connecting underused assets with unmet needs – a primary goal of complementary currencies – are clear.\nA reward currency scheme might enable businesses to exchange particular assets at reduced cost to loyal customers for points; or a trade network could provide otherwise underused services to other businesses in exchange for credit. For instance, spare cinema seats could be offered as competition prize or staff bonuses to another business, in exchange for credits. These credits can then be spent elsewhere in the network.\nTradeQoin case study\nManoushka Botts, founder of Amsterdam-based CarCleaners.nl, is a TradeQoin member. Speaking of the benefits, Manoushka says:\n“We have a number of cleaners on contract and during low season they have less work to do. I decided to start offering cleaning services in exchange for TradeQoin credit, which I can then spend on something I need for the business. What I’m looking for is a company or freelancer to help me develop a new website.”\nThe TradeQoin network not only provides Manoushka with another source of income, but connects her to other local SMEs, supporting the area’s economy overall.\nKeeping money circulating locally\nPumping money into an area is pointless if it flows straight back out again. Yet this is precisely what happens with national or (regarding the euro) international currency. This leakage occurs because, if high streets are dominated by multinational corporations with non-local supply chains and there is no geographical restriction on where the currency can be spent, profits will not remain within the locality.\n“The SoNantes benefits those who produce and consume locally. It doesn’t replace the euro, but provides an intelligent complement. It promotes local trade and short production and supply chains, allowing member SMEs to pay less in euros – helping them conserve their cash reserves. It gives each of us a new way to act for our region, for its development and for our jobs. It is a tool that we share so that everyone benefits.”\nPascal Bolo, First Deputy Mayor of Nantes\nLocal currencies that are specific to a particular geographical area offer ways to keep more of the money in that area. They can help to plug the leaks – reducing the level of profits flowing to headquarters of large corporations, rather than back to the people that work for them.8 Why does this matter? Because keeping money circulating\n                  052 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 053\nPART 01 C/02\nwithin a locality or SME network, through wages or supply chains for example, increases opportunities to reinvest in that community and strengthens both economic and social local infrastructures.\nChiemgauer\nThe Bavarian Chiemgauer is the first and largest of Germany’s Regiogeld initiatives. The currency incorporates demurrage, or negative interest: in order for Chiemgauer notes to remain valid at face value, a token must be purchased and attached every three months. This incentivises spending and discourages hoarding, meaning that the Chiemgauer circulates more rapidly and frequently than the euro. The 600 SMEs in the network meet around 50%\nof local people’s needs. Around 2500 users and 250 voluntary organisations also use the Chiemgauer.\nEusko\nThe Eusko is a regional currency launched in 2013 in Bayonne, a city in the French Basque Country. As of October 2013, it is the largest complementary currency in France, with more than 466 business members, 2,300 individual users and 170,000 Euskos in circulation.\nThe Eusko aims to relocalise the economy through encouraging local trade; develop social ties and solidarity; better value the Basque language and culture; support local projects of common interest; and reduce the environmental impacts of the economy.\nThe Eusko is backed and valued one-to-one with the euro.\nIf a certain critical mass of businesses and individuals using\na community currency is reached, then a mutually reinforcing relationship between benefits to local buyers and sellers should develop. As more local SMEs accept the currency, more individuals are encouraged to shop with them; local businesses then recycle community currency profits back through, for example, exchanges with other SMEs and bonuses to staff – using money that can then only be spent once more back in the local economy. A virtuous circle of spending and reinvestment is thereby created.\nWith production and supply currently so globalised, this ideal state is unlikely to be realised immediately. Community currency practitioners therefore actively identify and fill gaps in the local economy. One way to do this is to use national currency surplus – built up as individuals and businesses buy the local currency without redeeming it later – to make interest-free loans to sustainable local businesses that meet supply and production needs and gradually build a local economy that is both commercially and environmentally sustainable – and avoids leakage.\nEKO\nThe EKO is the community currency of the Findhorn ecovillage in north-west Scotland. Pegged to pound sterling, it operates alongside the village’s LETS to provide a strong and resilient local money system.\nThe EKO offers low-interest loans to various community projects. To date, these have included a youth project, a local co-operative and a community wind farm. A sustainable housing development will also soon be financed through the EKO. The currency contributes\nto the ecovillage’s overall vision of demonstrating an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable community-based development model.\nEducate consumers and increase customer loyalty\nCurrency projects can stimulate thinking and discussion about how money works and impacts a local economy. Raising people’s awareness of the socio-economic dimensions of their consumer behaviour can have direct benefits for local economies through increasing custom to participating businesses. As customers chat to business owners about why they’re participating in a community currency scheme, and what advantages it brings to both parties, stronger connections between local people and businesses are forged. This can create a more social high street, where business owners and customers get to know each other, as well as developing customer loyalty around the shared values represented by the currency. Both aspects can boost or stabilise the turnover of participating SMEs, as customers seek out participating businesses to spend their local money.\n                                               054 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 055\nPART 01 C/02\nLocal authorities, as major procurers of services and products, may be receptive to the benefits of community currencies. For instance, using a community currency to procure services is an active way to demonstrate support for independent businesses.\nBrixton Pound\nThe Brixton Pound is a community currency operating in South London, UK. Although primarily designed to support local SMEs, the Brixton Pound also seeks to increase the sense of community cohesion and draw on the area’s history of social activism.\nValued one-to-one against pound sterling, the Brixton Pound can only be spent with local SMEs and thereby aims to retain wealth within the community. Many participating businesses offer discounts to those paying in Brixton Pounds – in effect offering a loyalty scheme that both demonstrates their commitment to the local economy and increases custom. In the long term, increased links between Brixton-based SMEs themselves localise as far as possible supply and production chains to create a more sustainable and resilient economy for the area.\nThe Brixton Pound has demonstrated commitment to supporting independent businesses through vocal opposition to plans that\nwould see many well-known local establishments evicted from one\nof Brixton’s famous high streets: Atlantic Road. The high profile of\nthe Brixton Pound helped the campaign gain media attention and draw 13,000 signatures on a petition protesting the evictions (the campaign was ongoing at the time of writing). This demonstrates how currency initiatives can situate themselves within wider communal, social and political life and the benefits they can bring to an area beyond monetary value.\nSocial highstreet case study\nResearch from the University of Bristol and Brunel University, London, provides evidence that community currencies primarily designed to support the SME economy may also have significant social effects. According to the research, transactions using\nsuch currencies – in this case the Bristol Pound – contribute to people making connections to others, to their communities, to the\nenvironments they move through and to what they consume, while developing feelings of trust and opening up new kinds of interaction. In other words, the conscious choice of businesses and consumers to conduct economic exchanges via a medium that explicitly values and supports the local area and SMEs can lead to significant gains in community cohesion and reconfigure social relations.9\nOffer businesses and their customers new ways to transact\nCurrencies can provide businesses with point-of-sale options that they might not otherwise have been able to afford. A currency initiative incorporating digital systems, such as phone apps or pay-by-text options, allows participating traders to accept electronic payments – and offers customers new, often more convenient ways to purchase goods. Small businesses can thereby keep up with – or even move ahead of – the technology offered by large corporations, while the added convenience for customers can translate into a boost in sales.\nBrixton Pound case study\nBrixton Pound has pioneered new payment options for local traders. When the Brixton Pound launched their pay-by-text system, the added convenience prompted Alicia Reynolds – a Senior HR Officer at Lambeth Council – to request part of her salary in her local currency. In her words:\n“It saves me a trip to the bank. Sometimes I’ll go shopping, and then remember I don’t have any cash on me, but then I realise, I’ve got my Brixton Pounds. Paying by text means you don’t have to queue up and wait for change.”\nThe success of pay-by-text spurred on a further advancement\nin 2014 – the introduction of ‘tap and pay’ technology with a corresponding app. The new system uses near-field communication (NFC) technology, which allows smartphones and similar devices to make radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them into proximity.\nEvaluation of the Brixton Pound highlights the potential of community currencies to impact behaviour and affect attitudes. Of those using the currency, 70% reported that they had got to know local business owners better as a result, 55% that it had made shopping more convenient, 88% that it was good to be spending in a way that supported local values, and 82% that it had reinforced their pride in Brixton.10\n                                            056 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 057\nPART 01 C/02\nCountering inequality and social exclusion\nThe day-to-day costs of active involvement in local voluntary or leisure activities are often overlooked. On top of major household costs like rent, bills or mortgage payments, the cost of, for example, taking a bus to another part of town, or paying a child minder, often prohibits people on low incomes from participation in local events. Volunteering at a primary school or helping to run a coffee morning involves time and money that not everyone has. By redistributing resources more equally, community currencies can help to overcome these inequalities of free time and money.\nSocial participation\nExclusion of certain groups from social life weakens community relationships overall. Specially designed currencies can be used to oil the wheels of social participation, ensuring that all groups are given realistic, relevant and meaningful opportunities to get involved in their communities.\nSpice Time Credits\nSpice partners with local authorities, schools and housing associations to offer time-credits to individuals participating in voluntary programmes. Credits can then be traded between individual members – as in a traditional timebank – or spent at various non- profit, public or corporate partners. These currently include cinemas, gyms, family activities and vocational training. Spice also works with the public sector, utilising time-credits to introduce co-production to public services.\nAt both the earning and spending stages, one credit equals one hour of a person’s time or organisation’s services. The Spice system has its historical roots in the Welsh labour movement, when mining communities would contribute part of their wage to both support and access mutually owned local services, such as clinics, workingmen’s clubs and libraries.\nIt is important to clarify that community currencies cannot single-handedly overcome the deep social, economic and political inequalities that exist within societies. These are structural issues requiring structural change. Nonetheless, well-designed currencies offer a unique tool for addressing some of the drivers and effects of social exclusion.\nInvolvement in voluntary and community work offers many benefits to the socially excluded and economically marginalised: a chance\nto develop new relationships, valuable skills and a feeling of self-\nworth. The work of such projects is also of great worth to the wider community, mobilising local residents’ latent assets and skills. For example, credit-earning sessions allowing qualified but unemployed hairdressers to practise their skills and build up their haircutting experience also facilitate socialising. In this way, currency transactions can catalyse further community activity, as people think up new earning and spending opportunities for the currency system and form new relationships with local facilities, both private and public.\n                                                    058 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 059\nPART 01 C/02\n“The most exciting thing about time-credits is their diversity\nof applications. They can work with schools, social care, community connection, building social capacity. It can work whether you’re a small or big organisation. They really allow us to improve our interventions.”\nClaire Mattison, Lancashire County Council, discussing Spice Time Credits\nMoreover, the activities created through currency schemes give people extra incentives to engage with others in their area. If well designed, they can bring together a diverse range of groups: people from different generations, cultures, religions or social classes whose paths might not otherwise cross.\nMakkie case study\nThe time-based Makkie amplifies the impact of around 250 community projects in East Amsterdam. A founder of a community transport service that uses the Makkie explains:\n“Just going to the local market, to the hospital or to visit someone – those are the type of trips that pose a problem for the elderly. A taxi is too expensive and you have to order a ride with Connexxion [the local public transport company that offers trips for disabled and elderly] way in advance. Just getting dropped off for a\nsmall errand at the supermarket is impossible.”\nNow, she offers neighbourhood lifts in exchange for one Makkie. As\na result, elderly residents are no longer house-bound and can travel safely to wherever they need to go – having a good chat on the way.\nSupporting the core economy\nThe networks and relationships of trust within a community form the basis of social life and nurture the ground from which the formal economy of money and markets grows. However, as forms of unpaid work, the value of caring for relatives, raising children, assisting neighbours or carrying out household tasks like cooking, cleaning and managing finances, is generally not recognised in the formal economy. These ongoing tasks of maintaining and fuelling society and the lives that make it up, often but not exclusively carried out by women, constitute the ‘core economy’ – without which life as we know it would grind to a halt.\nMuch can be done to tap into, and strengthen, the core economy, as well as to better value and support it. Valuing here signifies the recognition of worth, of what this economy contributes and achieves, rather than putting a specific price on it. This is where community currencies can play a role.\nCurrencies based on time-exchanges explicitly recognise the skills of those making up the core economy. For instance, in a time-credit system, a neighbour providing respite care for a local carer can be rewarded for their time with a credit. This credit could then be redeemed for a school trip for their child or a trip to the local cinema. The idea is not to give volunteers a form of payment, as the activities themselves tend to be considered intrinsically valuable – in other words carrying them out is a reward in itself. Instead, time-credits are a recognition of the time spent in and for the wider community. They allow those carrying out this work to take up opportunities that might otherwise be inaccessible, or even donate their earned credits to local charities or vulnerable individuals.\nAddressing inequalities\nIn any given society, certain groups are more powerful and better-off financially than others. Social policies that aim to enhance or ‘grow’ the core economy must therefore go hand-in-hand with measures to promote greater equality within and between different\n                            060 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 061\nPART 01 C/02\n social groups. A systemic approach understands the dynamics\nof inequality: what the causes are and how they interact with and reinforce each other. Social and cultural factors such as gender,\nage, disability, ethnicity and sexual orientation influence the way people experience income and wealth inequality and often intensify disadvantages. Addressing complex systems of inequalities – both in economic and social terms – therefore requires specific strategies.\nCommunity currencies cannot be expected to tackle these inequalities alone, but they do offer a valuable tool. Crucial to reducing inequality of any type is empowerment. Community currencies can help redistribute power from those who already have it, through wealth or other forms of privilege, to those who don’t.\nSpice Time Credits case study\nCheryl Hughes first earned Ely Time Credits through participating in community projects, getting her whole family involved to earn enough for an upcoming day trip. Participating in these activities helped Cheryl build new relationships and get to know new people locally. She then formed a new group herself: Community Mothers. Cheryl says:\n“Time Credits opened my eyes. I never thought I would be able to do anything other than care for my children because of my dyslexia. It’s helped me gain confidence in myself and improve the way I now live my life.”\nEmpowerment and self-worth come hand in hand, and timebanks and time-based currencies that value a diverse range of skills and knowledge allow both to grow. The voluntary activities facilitated by a currency system enable participants to gain new experiences that offer intrinsic rewards, such as feelings of pride, but are also extrinsically valuable, as the skills they involve are widely applicable in the worlds of paid work and formal education. In this way, currency projects can directly address inequalities\nof learning, training and employability by putting those with less opportunity to gain the types of skills sought by employers on a more even footing with those who enjoy a more privileged status.\nImproving individual wellbeing and health\nMost people would agree that a successful society is one where economic activity delivers high levels of sustainable wellbeing for\nits citizens. In this context, wellbeing considers how people feel and function, and how they evaluate their lives. By providing opportunities for social contact and enhancing self-esteem, community currencies can contribute significantly to improving personal wellbeing.\nSuch projects offer avenues for socialisation and skill-learning to groups who, to varying degrees, may be excluded from the world of work. In these ways currency schemes can help reduce inequalities arising from high demands on service-provision in low-income areas – a strain that might arise because families with lower incomes have fewer resources to meet their own needs. Higher levels of wellbeing are often associated with positive outcomes such as improved physical health.\nFeeling better\nIndependent evaluation of time-credit schemes run by Spice shows that participants feel fitter, report fewer health problems and visit GPs less often. In 2014, independent impact assessment of Spice found that:\nz 65%ofusersreportedagenerallyimprovedqualityoflife z 45%reportedfeelinghealthier\nz 19%reportedgoingtothedoctorlessfrequently\nThese health benefits are likely knock-on effects of significantly increased levels of community engagement, which helps individuals to feel socially valued and empowered.11\n"

        "text": "- [[Eusko]]\nThe Eusko is a regional currency launched in 2013 in Bayonne, a city in the French Basque Country. As of October 2013, it is the largest complementary currency in France, with more than 466 business members, 2,300 individual users and 170,000 Euskos in circulation.\nThe Eusko aims to relocalise the economy through encouraging local trade; develop social ties and solidarity; better value the Basque language and culture; support local projects of common interest; and reduce the environmental impacts of the economy.\nThe Eusko is backed and valued one-to-one with the euro.\nIf a certain critical mass of businesses and individuals using\na community currency is reached, then a mutually reinforcing relationship between benefits to local buyers and sellers should develop. As more local SMEs accept the currency, more individuals are encouraged to shop with them; local businesses then recycle community currency profits back through, for example, exchanges with other SMEs and bonuses to staff – using money that can then only be spent once more back in the local economy. A virtuous circle of spending and reinvestment is thereby created.\nWith production and supply currently so globalised, this ideal state is unlikely to be realised immediately. Community currency practitioners therefore actively identify and fill gaps in the local economy. One way to do this is to use national currency surplus – built up as individuals and businesses buy the local currency without redeeming it later – to make interest-free loans to sustainable local businesses that meet supply and production needs and gradually build a local economy that is both commercially and environmentally sustainable – and avoids leakage.\nEKO\nThe EKO is the community currency of the Findhorn ecovillage in north-west Scotland. Pegged to pound sterling, it operates alongside the village’s LETS to provide a strong and resilient local money system.\nThe EKO offers low-interest loans to various community projects. To date, these have included a youth project, a local co-operative and a community wind farm. A sustainable housing development will also soon be financed through the EKO. The currency contributes\nto the ecovillage’s overall vision of demonstrating an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable community-based development model.\nEducate consumers and increase customer loyalty\nCurrency projects can stimulate thinking and discussion about how money works and impacts a local economy. Raising people’s awareness of the socio-economic dimensions of their consumer behaviour can have direct benefits for local economies through increasing custom to participating businesses. As customers chat to business owners about why they’re participating in a community currency scheme, and what advantages it brings to both parties, stronger connections between local people and businesses are forged. This can create a more social high street, where business owners and customers get to know each other, as well as developing customer loyalty around the shared values represented by the currency. Both aspects can boost or stabilise the turnover of participating SMEs, as customers seek out participating businesses to spend their local money.\n                                               054 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 055\nPART 01 C/02\nLocal authorities, as major procurers of services and products, may be receptive to the benefits of community currencies. For instance, using a community currency to procure services is an active way to demonstrate support for independent businesses.\nBrixton Pound\nThe Brixton Pound is a community currency operating in South London, UK. Although primarily designed to support local SMEs, the Brixton Pound also seeks to increase the sense of community cohesion and draw on the area’s history of social activism.\nValued one-to-one against pound sterling, the Brixton Pound can only be spent with local SMEs and thereby aims to retain wealth within the community. Many participating businesses offer discounts to those paying in Brixton Pounds – in effect offering a loyalty scheme that both demonstrates their commitment to the local economy and increases custom. In the long term, increased links between Brixton-based SMEs themselves localise as far as possible supply and production chains to create a more sustainable and resilient economy for the area.\nThe Brixton Pound has demonstrated commitment to supporting independent businesses through vocal opposition to plans that\nwould see many well-known local establishments evicted from one\nof Brixton’s famous high streets: Atlantic Road. The high profile of\nthe Brixton Pound helped the campaign gain media attention and draw 13,000 signatures on a petition protesting the evictions (the campaign was ongoing at the time of writing). This demonstrates how currency initiatives can situate themselves within wider communal, social and political life and the benefits they can bring to an area beyond monetary value.\nSocial highstreet case study\nResearch from the University of Bristol and Brunel University, London, provides evidence that community currencies primarily designed to support the SME economy may also have significant social effects. According to the research, transactions using\nsuch currencies – in this case the Bristol Pound – contribute to people making connections to others, to their communities, to the\nenvironments they move through and to what they consume, while developing feelings of trust and opening up new kinds of interaction. In other words, the conscious choice of businesses and consumers to conduct economic exchanges via a medium that explicitly values and supports the local area and SMEs can lead to significant gains in community cohesion and reconfigure social relations.9\nOffer businesses and their customers new ways to transact\nCurrencies can provide businesses with point-of-sale options that they might not otherwise have been able to afford. A currency initiative incorporating digital systems, such as phone apps or pay-by-text options, allows participating traders to accept electronic payments – and offers customers new, often more convenient ways to purchase goods. Small businesses can thereby keep up with – or even move ahead of – the technology offered by large corporations, while the added convenience for customers can translate into a boost in sales.\nBrixton Pound case study\nBrixton Pound has pioneered new payment options for local traders. When the Brixton Pound launched their pay-by-text system, the added convenience prompted Alicia Reynolds – a Senior HR Officer at Lambeth Council – to request part of her salary in her local currency. In her words:\n“It saves me a trip to the bank. Sometimes I’ll go shopping, and then remember I don’t have any cash on me, but then I realise, I’ve got my Brixton Pounds. Paying by text means you don’t have to queue up and wait for change.”\nThe success of pay-by-text spurred on a further advancement\nin 2014 – the introduction of ‘tap and pay’ technology with a corresponding app. The new system uses near-field communication (NFC) technology, which allows smartphones and similar devices to make radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them into proximity.\nEvaluation of the Brixton Pound highlights the potential of community currencies to impact behaviour and affect attitudes. Of those using the currency, 70% reported that they had got to know local business owners better as a result, 55% that it had made shopping more convenient, 88% that it was good to be spending in a way that supported local values, and 82% that it had reinforced their pride in Brixton.10\n                                            056 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 057\nPART 01 C/02\nCountering inequality and social exclusion\nThe day-to-day costs of active involvement in local voluntary or leisure activities are often overlooked. On top of major household costs like rent, bills or mortgage payments, the cost of, for example, taking a bus to another part of town, or paying a child minder, often prohibits people on low incomes from participation in local events. Volunteering at a primary school or helping to run a coffee morning involves time and money that not everyone has. By redistributing resources more equally, community currencies can help to overcome these inequalities of free time and money.\nSocial participation\nExclusion of certain groups from social life weakens community relationships overall. Specially designed currencies can be used to oil the wheels of social participation, ensuring that all groups are given realistic, relevant and meaningful opportunities to get involved in their communities.\nSpice Time Credits\nSpice partners with local authorities, schools and housing associations to offer time-credits to individuals participating in voluntary programmes. Credits can then be traded between individual members – as in a traditional timebank – or spent at various non- profit, public or corporate partners. These currently include cinemas, gyms, family activities and vocational training. Spice also works with the public sector, utilising time-credits to introduce co-production to public services.\nAt both the earning and spending stages, one credit equals one hour of a person’s time or organisation’s services. The Spice system has its historical roots in the Welsh labour movement, when mining communities would contribute part of their wage to both support and access mutually owned local services, such as clinics, workingmen’s clubs and libraries.\nIt is important to clarify that community currencies cannot single-handedly overcome the deep social, economic and political inequalities that exist within societies. These are structural issues requiring structural change. Nonetheless, well-designed currencies offer a unique tool for addressing some of the drivers and effects of social exclusion.\nInvolvement in voluntary and community work offers many benefits to the socially excluded and economically marginalised: a chance\nto develop new relationships, valuable skills and a feeling of self-\nworth. The work of such projects is also of great worth to the wider community, mobilising local residents’ latent assets and skills. For example, credit-earning sessions allowing qualified but unemployed hairdressers to practise their skills and build up their haircutting experience also facilitate socialising. In this way, currency transactions can catalyse further community activity, as people think up new earning and spending opportunities for the currency system and form new relationships with local facilities, both private and public.\n                                                    058 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 059\nPART 01 C/02\n“The most exciting thing about time-credits is their diversity\nof applications. They can work with schools, social care, community connection, building social capacity. It can work whether you’re a small or big organisation. They really allow us to improve our interventions.”\nClaire Mattison, Lancashire County Council, discussing Spice Time Credits\nMoreover, the activities created through currency schemes give people extra incentives to engage with others in their area. If well designed, they can bring together a diverse range of groups: people from different generations, cultures, religions or social classes whose paths might not otherwise cross.\nMakkie case study\nThe time-based Makkie amplifies the impact of around 250 community projects in East Amsterdam. A founder of a community transport service that uses the Makkie explains:\n“Just going to the local market, to the hospital or to visit someone – those are the type of trips that pose a problem for the elderly. A taxi is too expensive and you have to order a ride with Connexxion [the local public transport company that offers trips for disabled and elderly] way in advance. Just getting dropped off for a\nsmall errand at the supermarket is impossible.”\nNow, she offers neighbourhood lifts in exchange for one Makkie. As\na result, elderly residents are no longer house-bound and can travel safely to wherever they need to go – having a good chat on the way.\nSupporting the core economy\nThe networks and relationships of trust within a community form the basis of social life and nurture the ground from which the formal economy of money and markets grows. However, as forms of unpaid work, the value of caring for relatives, raising children, assisting neighbours or carrying out household tasks like cooking, cleaning and managing finances, is generally not recognised in the formal economy. These ongoing tasks of maintaining and fuelling society and the lives that make it up, often but not exclusively carried out by women, constitute the ‘core economy’ – without which life as we know it would grind to a halt.\nMuch can be done to tap into, and strengthen, the core economy, as well as to better value and support it. Valuing here signifies the recognition of worth, of what this economy contributes and achieves, rather than putting a specific price on it. This is where community currencies can play a role.\nCurrencies based on time-exchanges explicitly recognise the skills of those making up the core economy. For instance, in a time-credit system, a neighbour providing respite care for a local carer can be rewarded for their time with a credit. This credit could then be redeemed for a school trip for their child or a trip to the local cinema. The idea is not to give volunteers a form of payment, as the activities themselves tend to be considered intrinsically valuable – in other words carrying them out is a reward in itself. Instead, time-credits are a recognition of the time spent in and for the wider community. They allow those carrying out this work to take up opportunities that might otherwise be inaccessible, or even donate their earned credits to local charities or vulnerable individuals.\nAddressing inequalities\nIn any given society, certain groups are more powerful and better-off financially than others. Social policies that aim to enhance or ‘grow’ the core economy must therefore go hand-in-hand with measures to promote greater equality within and between different\n                            060 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 061\nPART 01 C/02\n social groups. A systemic approach understands the dynamics\nof inequality: what the causes are and how they interact with and reinforce each other. Social and cultural factors such as gender,\nage, disability, ethnicity and sexual orientation influence the way people experience income and wealth inequality and often intensify disadvantages. Addressing complex systems of inequalities – both in economic and social terms – therefore requires specific strategies.\nCommunity currencies cannot be expected to tackle these inequalities alone, but they do offer a valuable tool. Crucial to reducing inequality of any type is empowerment. Community currencies can help redistribute power from those who already have it, through wealth or other forms of privilege, to those who don’t.\nSpice Time Credits case study\nCheryl Hughes first earned Ely Time Credits through participating in community projects, getting her whole family involved to earn enough for an upcoming day trip. Participating in these activities helped Cheryl build new relationships and get to know new people locally. She then formed a new group herself: Community Mothers. Cheryl says:\n“Time Credits opened my eyes. I never thought I would be able to do anything other than care for my children because of my dyslexia. It’s helped me gain confidence in myself and improve the way I now live my life.”\nEmpowerment and self-worth come hand in hand, and timebanks and time-based currencies that value a diverse range of skills and knowledge allow both to grow. The voluntary activities facilitated by a currency system enable participants to gain new experiences that offer intrinsic rewards, such as feelings of pride, but are also extrinsically valuable, as the skills they involve are widely applicable in the worlds of paid work and formal education. In this way, currency projects can directly address inequalities\nof learning, training and employability by putting those with less opportunity to gain the types of skills sought by employers on a more even footing with those who enjoy a more privileged status.\nImproving individual wellbeing and health\nMost people would agree that a successful society is one where economic activity delivers high levels of sustainable wellbeing for\nits citizens. In this context, wellbeing considers how people feel and function, and how they evaluate their lives. By providing opportunities for social contact and enhancing self-esteem, community currencies can contribute significantly to improving personal wellbeing.\nSuch projects offer avenues for socialisation and skill-learning to groups who, to varying degrees, may be excluded from the world of work. In these ways currency schemes can help reduce inequalities arising from high demands on service-provision in low-income areas – a strain that might arise because families with lower incomes have fewer resources to meet their own needs. Higher levels of wellbeing are often associated with positive outcomes such as improved physical health.\nFeeling better\nIndependent evaluation of time-credit schemes run by Spice shows that participants feel fitter, report fewer health problems and visit GPs less often. In 2014, independent impact assessment of Spice found that:\nz 65%ofusersreportedagenerallyimprovedqualityoflife z 45%reportedfeelinghealthier\nz 19%reportedgoingtothedoctorlessfrequently\nThese health benefits are likely knock-on effects of significantly increased levels of community engagement, which helps individuals to feel socially valued and empowered.11\n"

        "text": "- [[Social highstreet case study]]\nResearch from the University of Bristol and Brunel University, London, provides evidence that community currencies primarily designed to support the SME economy may also have significant social effects. According to the research, transactions using\nsuch currencies – in this case the Bristol Pound – contribute to people making connections to others, to their communities, to the\nenvironments they move through and to what they consume, while developing feelings of trust and opening up new kinds of interaction. In other words, the conscious choice of businesses and consumers to conduct economic exchanges via a medium that explicitly values and supports the local area and SMEs can lead to significant gains in community cohesion and reconfigure social relations.9\nOffer businesses and their customers new ways to transact\nCurrencies can provide businesses with point-of-sale options that they might not otherwise have been able to afford. A currency initiative incorporating digital systems, such as phone apps or pay-by-text options, allows participating traders to accept electronic payments – and offers customers new, often more convenient ways to purchase goods. Small businesses can thereby keep up with – or even move ahead of – the technology offered by large corporations, while the added convenience for customers can translate into a boost in sales.\nBrixton Pound case study\nBrixton Pound has pioneered new payment options for local traders. When the Brixton Pound launched their pay-by-text system, the added convenience prompted Alicia Reynolds – a Senior HR Officer at Lambeth Council – to request part of her salary in her local currency. In her words:\n“It saves me a trip to the bank. Sometimes I’ll go shopping, and then remember I don’t have any cash on me, but then I realise, I’ve got my Brixton Pounds. Paying by text means you don’t have to queue up and wait for change.”\nThe success of pay-by-text spurred on a further advancement\nin 2014 – the introduction of ‘tap and pay’ technology with a corresponding app. The new system uses near-field communication (NFC) technology, which allows smartphones and similar devices to make radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them into proximity.\nEvaluation of the Brixton Pound highlights the potential of community currencies to impact behaviour and affect attitudes. Of those using the currency, 70% reported that they had got to know local business owners better as a result, 55% that it had made shopping more convenient, 88% that it was good to be spending in a way that supported local values, and 82% that it had reinforced their pride in Brixton.10\n                                            056 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 057\nPART 01 C/02\nCountering inequality and social exclusion\nThe day-to-day costs of active involvement in local voluntary or leisure activities are often overlooked. On top of major household costs like rent, bills or mortgage payments, the cost of, for example, taking a bus to another part of town, or paying a child minder, often prohibits people on low incomes from participation in local events. Volunteering at a primary school or helping to run a coffee morning involves time and money that not everyone has. By redistributing resources more equally, community currencies can help to overcome these inequalities of free time and money.\nSocial participation\nExclusion of certain groups from social life weakens community relationships overall. Specially designed currencies can be used to oil the wheels of social participation, ensuring that all groups are given realistic, relevant and meaningful opportunities to get involved in their communities.\nSpice Time Credits\nSpice partners with local authorities, schools and housing associations to offer time-credits to individuals participating in voluntary programmes. Credits can then be traded between individual members – as in a traditional timebank – or spent at various non- profit, public or corporate partners. These currently include cinemas, gyms, family activities and vocational training. Spice also works with the public sector, utilising time-credits to introduce co-production to public services.\nAt both the earning and spending stages, one credit equals one hour of a person’s time or organisation’s services. The Spice system has its historical roots in the Welsh labour movement, when mining communities would contribute part of their wage to both support and access mutually owned local services, such as clinics, workingmen’s clubs and libraries.\nIt is important to clarify that community currencies cannot single-handedly overcome the deep social, economic and political inequalities that exist within societies. These are structural issues requiring structural change. Nonetheless, well-designed currencies offer a unique tool for addressing some of the drivers and effects of social exclusion.\nInvolvement in voluntary and community work offers many benefits to the socially excluded and economically marginalised: a chance\nto develop new relationships, valuable skills and a feeling of self-\nworth. The work of such projects is also of great worth to the wider community, mobilising local residents’ latent assets and skills. For example, credit-earning sessions allowing qualified but unemployed hairdressers to practise their skills and build up their haircutting experience also facilitate socialising. In this way, currency transactions can catalyse further community activity, as people think up new earning and spending opportunities for the currency system and form new relationships with local facilities, both private and public.\n                                                    058 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 059\nPART 01 C/02\n“The most exciting thing about time-credits is their diversity\nof applications. They can work with schools, social care, community connection, building social capacity. It can work whether you’re a small or big organisation. They really allow us to improve our interventions.”\nClaire Mattison, Lancashire County Council, discussing Spice Time Credits\nMoreover, the activities created through currency schemes give people extra incentives to engage with others in their area. If well designed, they can bring together a diverse range of groups: people from different generations, cultures, religions or social classes whose paths might not otherwise cross.\nMakkie case study\nThe time-based Makkie amplifies the impact of around 250 community projects in East Amsterdam. A founder of a community transport service that uses the Makkie explains:\n“Just going to the local market, to the hospital or to visit someone – those are the type of trips that pose a problem for the elderly. A taxi is too expensive and you have to order a ride with Connexxion [the local public transport company that offers trips for disabled and elderly] way in advance. Just getting dropped off for a\nsmall errand at the supermarket is impossible.”\nNow, she offers neighbourhood lifts in exchange for one Makkie. As\na result, elderly residents are no longer house-bound and can travel safely to wherever they need to go – having a good chat on the way.\nSupporting the core economy\nThe networks and relationships of trust within a community form the basis of social life and nurture the ground from which the formal economy of money and markets grows. However, as forms of unpaid work, the value of caring for relatives, raising children, assisting neighbours or carrying out household tasks like cooking, cleaning and managing finances, is generally not recognised in the formal economy. These ongoing tasks of maintaining and fuelling society and the lives that make it up, often but not exclusively carried out by women, constitute the ‘core economy’ – without which life as we know it would grind to a halt.\nMuch can be done to tap into, and strengthen, the core economy, as well as to better value and support it. Valuing here signifies the recognition of worth, of what this economy contributes and achieves, rather than putting a specific price on it. This is where community currencies can play a role.\nCurrencies based on time-exchanges explicitly recognise the skills of those making up the core economy. For instance, in a time-credit system, a neighbour providing respite care for a local carer can be rewarded for their time with a credit. This credit could then be redeemed for a school trip for their child or a trip to the local cinema. The idea is not to give volunteers a form of payment, as the activities themselves tend to be considered intrinsically valuable – in other words carrying them out is a reward in itself. Instead, time-credits are a recognition of the time spent in and for the wider community. They allow those carrying out this work to take up opportunities that might otherwise be inaccessible, or even donate their earned credits to local charities or vulnerable individuals.\nAddressing inequalities\nIn any given society, certain groups are more powerful and better-off financially than others. Social policies that aim to enhance or ‘grow’ the core economy must therefore go hand-in-hand with measures to promote greater equality within and between different\n                            060 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 061\nPART 01 C/02\n social groups. A systemic approach understands the dynamics\nof inequality: what the causes are and how they interact with and reinforce each other. Social and cultural factors such as gender,\nage, disability, ethnicity and sexual orientation influence the way people experience income and wealth inequality and often intensify disadvantages. Addressing complex systems of inequalities – both in economic and social terms – therefore requires specific strategies.\nCommunity currencies cannot be expected to tackle these inequalities alone, but they do offer a valuable tool. Crucial to reducing inequality of any type is empowerment. Community currencies can help redistribute power from those who already have it, through wealth or other forms of privilege, to those who don’t.\nSpice Time Credits case study\nCheryl Hughes first earned Ely Time Credits through participating in community projects, getting her whole family involved to earn enough for an upcoming day trip. Participating in these activities helped Cheryl build new relationships and get to know new people locally. She then formed a new group herself: Community Mothers. Cheryl says:\n“Time Credits opened my eyes. I never thought I would be able to do anything other than care for my children because of my dyslexia. It’s helped me gain confidence in myself and improve the way I now live my life.”\nEmpowerment and self-worth come hand in hand, and timebanks and time-based currencies that value a diverse range of skills and knowledge allow both to grow. The voluntary activities facilitated by a currency system enable participants to gain new experiences that offer intrinsic rewards, such as feelings of pride, but are also extrinsically valuable, as the skills they involve are widely applicable in the worlds of paid work and formal education. In this way, currency projects can directly address inequalities\nof learning, training and employability by putting those with less opportunity to gain the types of skills sought by employers on a more even footing with those who enjoy a more privileged status.\nImproving individual wellbeing and health\nMost people would agree that a successful society is one where economic activity delivers high levels of sustainable wellbeing for\nits citizens. In this context, wellbeing considers how people feel and function, and how they evaluate their lives. By providing opportunities for social contact and enhancing self-esteem, community currencies can contribute significantly to improving personal wellbeing.\nSuch projects offer avenues for socialisation and skill-learning to groups who, to varying degrees, may be excluded from the world of work. In these ways currency schemes can help reduce inequalities arising from high demands on service-provision in low-income areas – a strain that might arise because families with lower incomes have fewer resources to meet their own needs. Higher levels of wellbeing are often associated with positive outcomes such as improved physical health.\nFeeling better\nIndependent evaluation of time-credit schemes run by Spice shows that participants feel fitter, report fewer health problems and visit GPs less often. In 2014, independent impact assessment of Spice found that:\nz 65%ofusersreportedagenerallyimprovedqualityoflife z 45%reportedfeelinghealthier\nz 19%reportedgoingtothedoctorlessfrequently\nThese health benefits are likely knock-on effects of significantly increased levels of community engagement, which helps individuals to feel socially valued and empowered.11\n"

According to the research, transactions using\nsuch currencies – in this case the Bristol Pound – contribute to people making connections to others, to their communities, to the\nenvironments they move through and to what they consume, while developing feelings of trust and opening up new kinds of interaction. In other words, the conscious choice of businesses and consumers to conduct economic exchanges via a medium that explicitly values and supports the local area and SMEs can lead to significant gains in community cohesion and reconfigure social relations."

        "text": "Currencies can provide businesses with point-of-sale options that they might not otherwise have been able to afford. A currency initiative incorporating digital systems, such as phone apps or pay-by-text options, allows participating traders to accept electronic payments – and offers customers new, often more convenient ways to purchase goods. Small businesses can thereby keep up with – or even move ahead of – the technology offered by large corporations, while the added convenience for customers can translate into a boost in sales.\nBrixton Pound case study\nBrixton Pound has pioneered new payment options for local traders. When the Brixton Pound launched their pay-by-text system, the added convenience prompted Alicia Reynolds – a Senior HR Officer at Lambeth Council – to request part of her salary in her local currency. In her words:\n“It saves me a trip to the bank. Sometimes I’ll go shopping, and then remember I don’t have any cash on me, but then I realise, I’ve got my Brixton Pounds. Paying by text means you don’t have to queue up and wait for change.”\nThe success of pay-by-text spurred on a further advancement\nin 2014 – the introduction of ‘tap and pay’ technology with a corresponding app. The new system uses near-field communication (NFC) technology, which allows smartphones and similar devices to make radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them into proximity.\nEvaluation of the Brixton Pound highlights the potential of community currencies to impact behaviour and affect attitudes. Of those using the currency, 70% reported that they had got to know local business owners better as a result, 55% that it had made shopping more convenient, 88% that it was good to be spending in a way that supported local values, and 82% that it had reinforced their pride in Brixton.10\n                                            056 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 057\nPART 01 C/02\nCountering inequality and social exclusion\nThe day-to-day costs of active involvement in local voluntary or leisure activities are often overlooked. On top of major household costs like rent, bills or mortgage payments, the cost of, for example, taking a bus to another part of town, or paying a child minder, often prohibits people on low incomes from participation in local events. Volunteering at a primary school or helping to run a coffee morning involves time and money that not everyone has. By redistributing resources more equally, community currencies can help to overcome these inequalities of free time and money.\nSocial participation\nExclusion of certain groups from social life weakens community relationships overall. Specially designed currencies can be used to oil the wheels of social participation, ensuring that all groups are given realistic, relevant and meaningful opportunities to get involved in their communities.\nSpice Time Credits\nSpice partners with local authorities, schools and housing associations to offer time-credits to individuals participating in voluntary programmes. Credits can then be traded between individual members – as in a traditional timebank – or spent at various non- profit, public or corporate partners. These currently include cinemas, gyms, family activities and vocational training. Spice also works with the public sector, utilising time-credits to introduce co-production to public services.\nAt both the earning and spending stages, one credit equals one hour of a person’s time or organisation’s services. The Spice system has its historical roots in the Welsh labour movement, when mining communities would contribute part of their wage to both support and access mutually owned local services, such as clinics, workingmen’s clubs and libraries.\nIt is important to clarify that community currencies cannot single-handedly overcome the deep social, economic and political inequalities that exist within societies. These are structural issues requiring structural change. Nonetheless, well-designed currencies offer a unique tool for addressing some of the drivers and effects of social exclusion.\nInvolvement in voluntary and community work offers many benefits to the socially excluded and economically marginalised: a chance\nto develop new relationships, valuable skills and a feeling of self-\nworth. The work of such projects is also of great worth to the wider community, mobilising local residents’ latent assets and skills. For example, credit-earning sessions allowing qualified but unemployed hairdressers to practise their skills and build up their haircutting experience also facilitate socialising. In this way, currency transactions can catalyse further community activity, as people think up new earning and spending opportunities for the currency system and form new relationships with local facilities, both private and public.\n                                                    058 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 059\nPART 01 C/02\n“The most exciting thing about time-credits is their diversity\nof applications. They can work with schools, social care, community connection, building social capacity. It can work whether you’re a small or big organisation. They really allow us to improve our interventions.”\nClaire Mattison, Lancashire County Council, discussing Spice Time Credits\nMoreover, the activities created through currency schemes give people extra incentives to engage with others in their area. If well designed, they can bring together a diverse range of groups: people from different generations, cultures, religions or social classes whose paths might not otherwise cross.\nMakkie case study\nThe time-based Makkie amplifies the impact of around 250 community projects in East Amsterdam. A founder of a community transport service that uses the Makkie explains:\n“Just going to the local market, to the hospital or to visit someone – those are the type of trips that pose a problem for the elderly. A taxi is too expensive and you have to order a ride with Connexxion [the local public transport company that offers trips for disabled and elderly] way in advance. Just getting dropped off for a\nsmall errand at the supermarket is impossible.”\nNow, she offers neighbourhood lifts in exchange for one Makkie. As\na result, elderly residents are no longer house-bound and can travel safely to wherever they need to go – having a good chat on the way.\nSupporting the core economy\nThe networks and relationships of trust within a community form the basis of social life and nurture the ground from which the formal economy of money and markets grows. However, as forms of unpaid work, the value of caring for relatives, raising children, assisting neighbours or carrying out household tasks like cooking, cleaning and managing finances, is generally not recognised in the formal economy. These ongoing tasks of maintaining and fuelling society and the lives that make it up, often but not exclusively carried out by women, constitute the ‘core economy’ – without which life as we know it would grind to a halt.\nMuch can be done to tap into, and strengthen, the core economy, as well as to better value and support it. Valuing here signifies the recognition of worth, of what this economy contributes and achieves, rather than putting a specific price on it. This is where community currencies can play a role.\nCurrencies based on time-exchanges explicitly recognise the skills of those making up the core economy. For instance, in a time-credit system, a neighbour providing respite care for a local carer can be rewarded for their time with a credit. This credit could then be redeemed for a school trip for their child or a trip to the local cinema. The idea is not to give volunteers a form of payment, as the activities themselves tend to be considered intrinsically valuable – in other words carrying them out is a reward in itself. Instead, time-credits are a recognition of the time spent in and for the wider community. They allow those carrying out this work to take up opportunities that might otherwise be inaccessible, or even donate their earned credits to local charities or vulnerable individuals.\nAddressing inequalities\nIn any given society, certain groups are more powerful and better-off financially than others. Social policies that aim to enhance or ‘grow’ the core economy must therefore go hand-in-hand with measures to promote greater equality within and between different\n                            060 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 061\nPART 01 C/02\n social groups. A systemic approach understands the dynamics\nof inequality: what the causes are and how they interact with and reinforce each other. Social and cultural factors such as gender,\nage, disability, ethnicity and sexual orientation influence the way people experience income and wealth inequality and often intensify disadvantages. Addressing complex systems of inequalities – both in economic and social terms – therefore requires specific strategies.\nCommunity currencies cannot be expected to tackle these inequalities alone, but they do offer a valuable tool. Crucial to reducing inequality of any type is empowerment. Community currencies can help redistribute power from those who already have it, through wealth or other forms of privilege, to those who don’t.\nSpice Time Credits case study\nCheryl Hughes first earned Ely Time Credits through participating in community projects, getting her whole family involved to earn enough for an upcoming day trip. Participating in these activities helped Cheryl build new relationships and get to know new people locally. She then formed a new group herself: Community Mothers. Cheryl says:\n“Time Credits opened my eyes. I never thought I would be able to do anything other than care for my children because of my dyslexia. It’s helped me gain confidence in myself and improve the way I now live my life.”\nEmpowerment and self-worth come hand in hand, and timebanks and time-based currencies that value a diverse range of skills and knowledge allow both to grow. The voluntary activities facilitated by a currency system enable participants to gain new experiences that offer intrinsic rewards, such as feelings of pride, but are also extrinsically valuable, as the skills they involve are widely applicable in the worlds of paid work and formal education. In this way, currency projects can directly address inequalities\nof learning, training and employability by putting those with less opportunity to gain the types of skills sought by employers on a more even footing with those who enjoy a more privileged status.\nImproving individual wellbeing and health\nMost people would agree that a successful society is one where economic activity delivers high levels of sustainable wellbeing for\nits citizens. In this context, wellbeing considers how people feel and function, and how they evaluate their lives. By providing opportunities for social contact and enhancing self-esteem, community currencies can contribute significantly to improving personal wellbeing.\nSuch projects offer avenues for socialisation and skill-learning to groups who, to varying degrees, may be excluded from the world of work. In these ways currency schemes can help reduce inequalities arising from high demands on service-provision in low-income areas – a strain that might arise because families with lower incomes have fewer resources to meet their own needs. Higher levels of wellbeing are often associated with positive outcomes such as improved physical health.\nFeeling better\nIndependent evaluation of time-credit schemes run by Spice shows that participants feel fitter, report fewer health problems and visit GPs less often. In 2014, independent impact assessment of Spice found that:\nz 65%ofusersreportedagenerallyimprovedqualityoflife z 45%reportedfeelinghealthier\nz 19%reportedgoingtothedoctorlessfrequently\nThese health benefits are likely knock-on effects of significantly increased levels of community engagement, which helps individuals to feel socially valued and empowered.11\n"
