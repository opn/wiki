The first allocation, or ‘mining’, and consecutive transfer of coins is independent of any central authority or regulation. Bitcoins are transferred through a computer or smartphone without an intermediate financial institution.\nAs a currency it’s simply a new medium through which to trade, operating under parameters such as the total number in circulation, the method by which new units are allocated and free-market pricing. Bitcoin payment systems use a decentralised ledger, which operates through a peer-to-peer network, to cut out the middleman role usually performed by a bank. This means the record of all transactions is not held centrally, but in a network of computers, which confirm the validity of new transactions using special encoding technology.\nThe table below gives examples of complementary currencies active in Europe and further afield, showing the range of media used to serve various functions.\nTable 1: Community currency denomination and transaction media\n    Currency\n unit of account\n   Denomination\n  medium\n   Brixton Pound\n £ sterling\n   Brixton £\n  paper, website, app, SMS\n   Bitcoin\n  Bitcoin\n    bitcoin, satoshies\n   electronic\n   e-Portemonnee\nmanaged at par with 0.01 €\n  points\n electronic, national ID as show card\n   Krugerrand\n  ounces of gold\n    Krugerrand\n   coin\n   Loyalty card\npoints\n  miles, points etc.\n swipe card, websites, stamp cards\n   Makkie\n  time\n    hour, half hour\n   paper, website\n   SoNantes\n euro\n   SoNantes\n  app, SMS, website, smart card\n   Spice Time Credits\ntime\n  time-credit\n paper and online registry\n   Terra\n managed price of commodities basket\n   Terra\n  electronic\n   TradeQoin\n  euro\n    TradeQoin\n   website, app\n   Ven\n floating price of currency and commodities basket\n   Ven\n  website, app\n     Kruggerand\nThe Krugerrand is a South African 22-karat gold coin, available in denominations of half, quarter and a tenth of an ounce of gold.
