A currency can, for example, function as a savings and reward system where credits earned through environmentally friendly activities, such as switching to a green energy provider or bringing domestic waste to the local recycling centre, can be exchanged for public services and environmentally friendly products. Other currencies can mobilise investment in renewable energy, whether at a household, corporate or state level.\ne-Portemonnee\ne-Portemonnee (E-Wallet) is an electronic savings and reward system designed to reduce household waste and support environmentally sustainable behaviour in the 44 municipalities of the East Belgian province of Limburg. Municipalities can award digital credits to residents for environmentally positive actions, such as switching to a green energy provider, donating goods\nto a local second-hand shop, or composting food waste. These credits, accessed through the participants’ national ID cards, can then be spent on sustainable services and products, such as public transport, environmentally friendly household products or educational courses.\n“Home composting, reduction of water consumption, switching to green power ... these are just a few of the many ways in which people can earn points with e-Portemonnee. There are people now who actively search for opportunities to earn and spend credits. And that’s great, of course, because it means that with the e-Portemonnee,\nyou can really affect people’s daily behaviour, which means that the benefits will be long-lasting and more widespread.”\nLeen Frensen, Sustainability Officer, Diepenbeel, Belgium.\nValue natural resources: linking money and nature\nAt global level, many argue for a stable unit of account that reflects the planet’s natural capacities. Such a currency would not solely facilitate trade and pay taxes, as mainstream money does today, but also account\nfor the finite natural resources that a monetised economy is based on. Rather than being excluded from economic decisions, as they often are today, environmental considerations could be ‘priced into markets’ through, for example, accounting for the renewable energy used to produce kilowatt-hours of electricity. This is an ambitious aim that would require top-down economic and monetary reforms.12\nTerra\nThe ‘Terra’ is a proposal for a commodity-backed currency, proposed by Belgian economist Bernard Lietaer. Like other comparable models, the Terra is designed as an inflation-immune currency capable of stabilising global trade. This is achieved by linking the value of the currency to a ‘basket’ of around a dozen core commodities, such as oil, gold and copper.\nAs the value of these commodities rises (or, indeed, falls),\nso will the value of the currency, meaning that its ‘real’ value should remain constant in relation to the ‘real’ productive and commodity-based economy – that is, non-inflationary. The Terra is proposed as an international unit of exchange capable of providing businesses and states with a stable and shared measure of value regardless of wider inflation.\nAt local or regional level, energy currencies can promote more sustainable consumption and generate funds for investment in renewable energy production. These self-financing currencies could be redeemable in local participating businesses and, potentially, with producers of local renewable energy.\nSolarCoin\nSolarCoin is a digital currency incentivising the production and use of solar electricity. The technology behind the currency is similar to the better-known Bitcoin; however, as the name suggests, SolarCoin has a specific environmental aim. Producers of clean solar energy receive the currency on top of their feed-in tariffs for generating solar power.\n                                          064 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 065\nPART 01 C/02\nSupport sustainable business practices\nWell designed and implemented community currencies encourage businesses to adopt more sustainable practices. This can be done in numerous ways, with different objectives requiring different types of currency.\nReward currencies can incentivise the purchase of more sustainable products among consumers: points earned when making a purchase can be redeemed as a discount the next time a sustainable product\nis bought. This in turn incentivises businesses to stock more of such commodities. Reward schemes can also target businesses or public institutions directly by providing access to growing networks of ethical consumers for organisations that switch to more sustainable practices, or incentivising public bodies to adopt sustainability criteria into their procurement processes.\nLocal currencies can encourage sustainability by tracing back through production and supply chains and encouraging potential local suppliers to join the scheme. This provides opportunities for businesses as well as consumers to spend locally when sourcing materials and products, reducing carbon emissions generated by transportation of goods.\nEco-Iris\nThe Eco-Iris is a local currency introduced in the Brussels region by the Ministry of Environment to promote sustainable behaviour and purchasing, boost the local economy and improve community cohesion. It is currently operating across five neighbourhoods. As with the e-Portemonnee in Belgium, members receive Eco-Iris for switching to environmentally friendly lifestyles or purchasing sustainable goods and services.\nLocal associations, shops and traders can also join, increasing spend options for members. Although not technically backed by legal tender, business owners may exchange excess Eco-Iris into euros at the Brussels Environment Ministry, at a discount.\nThis chapter has provided an overview of the most common aims of community currency projects. Turning now to the question of ‘Who’, in the following chapter we consider the roles of partners, backers and users – the motor of these people-powered money systems."

This can be done in numerous ways, with different objectives requiring different types of currency.\nReward currencies can incentivise the purchase of more sustainable products among consumers: points earned when making a purchase can be redeemed as a discount the next time a sustainable product\nis bought. This in turn incentivises businesses to stock more of such commodities. Reward schemes can also target businesses or public institutions directly by providing access to growing networks of ethical consumers for organisations that switch to more sustainable practices, or incentivising public bodies to adopt sustainability criteria into their procurement processes.\nLocal currencies can encourage sustainability by tracing back through production and supply chains and encouraging potential local suppliers to join the scheme. This provides opportunities for businesses as well as consumers to spend locally when sourcing materials and products, reducing carbon emissions generated by transportation of goods."

Like other comparable models, the Terra is designed as an inflation-immune currency capable of stabilising global trade. This is achieved by linking the value of the currency to a ‘basket’ of around a dozen core commodities, such as oil, gold and copper.\nAs the value of these commodities rises (or, indeed, falls), so will the value of the currency, meaning that its ‘real’ value should remain constant in relation to the ‘real’ productive and commodity-based economy – that is, non-inflationary. The Terra is proposed as an international unit of exchange capable of providing businesses and states with a stable and shared measure of value regardless of wider inflation.\nAt local or regional level, energy currencies can promote more sustainable consumption and generate funds for investment in renewable energy production. These self-financing currencies could be redeemable in local participating businesses and, potentially, with producers of local renewable energy."
