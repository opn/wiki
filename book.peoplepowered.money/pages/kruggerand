      "text": "The Krugerrand is a South African 22-karat gold coin, available in denominations of half, quarter and a tenth of an ounce of gold. First minted in 1967 to help market South African gold, the Krugerrand has since become the most popular choice for global investors wanting to purchase gold. Unusually, the Krugerrand has the status of legal tender in South Africa, meaning that its units can properly be referred to as ‘coins’, rather than ‘rounds’ – the technical term for similar, non-legal- tender gold media produced elsewhere."
