[[Linden dollars]] (the currency of virtual world Second Life) and [[Bitcoin]] have been integrated into banking systems; large corporations too have initiated currency systems – for profit-driven purposes – such as [[Amazon Points]], [[Google Wallet]] and [[Apple Pay]]. The rapid development of digital payment systems further demonstrates that money is a tool to be shaped and used."
