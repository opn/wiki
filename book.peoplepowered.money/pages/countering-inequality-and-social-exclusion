On top of major household costs like rent, bills or mortgage payments, the cost of, for example, taking a bus to another part of town, or paying a child minder, often prohibits people on low incomes from participation in local events. Volunteering at a primary school or helping to run a coffee morning involves time and money that not everyone has. By redistributing resources more equally, community currencies can help to overcome these inequalities of free time and money.\nSocial participation\nExclusion of certain groups from social life weakens community relationships overall. Specially designed currencies can be used to oil the wheels of social participation, ensuring that all groups are given realistic, relevant and meaningful opportunities to get involved in their communities.\nSpice Time Credits\nSpice partners with local authorities, schools and housing associations to offer time-credits to individuals participating in voluntary programmes. Credits can then be traded between individual members – as in a traditional timebank – or spent at various non- profit, public or corporate partners. These currently include cinemas, gyms, family activities and vocational training. Spice also works with the public sector, utilising time-credits to introduce co-production to public services.\nAt both the earning and spending stages, one credit equals one hour of a person’s time or organisation’s services. The Spice system has its historical roots in the Welsh labour movement, when mining communities would contribute part of their wage to both support and access mutually owned local services, such as clinics, workingmen’s clubs and libraries.\nIt is important to clarify that community currencies cannot single-handedly overcome the deep social, economic and political inequalities that exist within societies. These are structural issues requiring structural change. Nonetheless, well-designed currencies offer a unique tool for addressing some of the drivers and effects of social exclusion.\nInvolvement in voluntary and community work offers many benefits to the socially excluded and economically marginalised: a chance\nto develop new relationships, valuable skills and a feeling of self-\nworth. The work of such projects is also of great worth to the wider community, mobilising local residents’ latent assets and skills. For example, credit-earning sessions allowing qualified but unemployed hairdressers to practise their skills and build up their haircutting experience also facilitate socialising. In this way, currency transactions can catalyse further community activity, as people think up new earning and spending opportunities for the currency system and form new relationships with local facilities, both private and public.\n                                                    058 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 059\nPART 01 C/02\n“The most exciting thing about time-credits is their diversity\nof applications. They can work with schools, social care, community connection, building social capacity. It can work whether you’re a small or big organisation. They really allow us to improve our interventions.”\nClaire Mattison, Lancashire County Council, discussing Spice Time Credits\nMoreover, the activities created through currency schemes give people extra incentives to engage with others in their area. If well designed, they can bring together a diverse range of groups: people from different generations, cultures, religions or social classes whose paths might not otherwise cross.\nMakkie case study\nThe time-based Makkie amplifies the impact of around 250 community projects in East Amsterdam. A founder of a community transport service that uses the Makkie explains:\n“Just going to the local market, to the hospital or to visit someone – those are the type of trips that pose a problem for the elderly. A taxi is too expensive and you have to order a ride with Connexxion [the local public transport company that offers trips for disabled and elderly] way in advance. Just getting dropped off for a\nsmall errand at the supermarket is impossible.”\nNow, she offers neighbourhood lifts in exchange for one Makkie. As\na result, elderly residents are no longer house-bound and can travel safely to wherever they need to go – having a good chat on the way.\nSupporting the core economy\nThe networks and relationships of trust within a community form the basis of social life and nurture the ground from which the formal economy of money and markets grows. However, as forms of unpaid work, the value of caring for relatives, raising children, assisting neighbours or carrying out household tasks like cooking, cleaning and managing finances, is generally not recognised in the formal economy. These ongoing tasks of maintaining and fuelling society and the lives that make it up, often but not exclusively carried out by women, constitute the ‘core economy’ – without which life as we know it would grind to a halt.\nMuch can be done to tap into, and strengthen, the core economy, as well as to better value and support it. Valuing here signifies the recognition of worth, of what this economy contributes and achieves, rather than putting a specific price on it. This is where community currencies can play a role.\nCurrencies based on time-exchanges explicitly recognise the skills of those making up the core economy. For instance, in a time-credit system, a neighbour providing respite care for a local carer can be rewarded for their time with a credit. This credit could then be redeemed for a school trip for their child or a trip to the local cinema. The idea is not to give volunteers a form of payment, as the activities themselves tend to be considered intrinsically valuable – in other words carrying them out is a reward in itself. Instead, time-credits are a recognition of the time spent in and for the wider community. They allow those carrying out this work to take up opportunities that might otherwise be inaccessible, or even donate their earned credits to local charities or vulnerable individuals.\nAddressing inequalities\nIn any given society, certain groups are more powerful and better-off financially than others. Social policies that aim to enhance or ‘grow’ the core economy must therefore go hand-in-hand with measures to promote greater equality within and between different\n                            060 PEOPLE POWERED MONEY\nPEOPLE POWERED MONEY 061\nPART 01 C/02\n social groups. A systemic approach understands the dynamics\nof inequality: what the causes are and how they interact with and reinforce each other. Social and cultural factors such as gender,\nage, disability, ethnicity and sexual orientation influence the way people experience income and wealth inequality and often intensify disadvantages. Addressing complex systems of inequalities – both in economic and social terms – therefore requires specific strategies.\nCommunity currencies cannot be expected to tackle these inequalities alone, but they do offer a valuable tool. Crucial to reducing inequality of any type is empowerment. Community currencies can help redistribute power from those who already have it, through wealth or other forms of privilege, to those who don’t.\nSpice Time Credits case study\nCheryl Hughes first earned Ely Time Credits through participating in community projects, getting her whole family involved to earn enough for an upcoming day trip. Participating in these activities helped Cheryl build new relationships and get to know new people locally. She then formed a new group herself: Community Mothers. Cheryl says:\n“Time Credits opened my eyes. I never thought I would be able to do anything other than care for my children because of my dyslexia. It’s helped me gain confidence in myself and improve the way I now live my life.”\nEmpowerment and self-worth come hand in hand, and timebanks and time-based currencies that value a diverse range of skills and knowledge allow both to grow. The voluntary activities facilitated by a currency system enable participants to gain new experiences that offer intrinsic rewards, such as feelings of pride, but are also extrinsically valuable, as the skills they involve are widely applicable in the worlds of paid work and formal education. In this way, currency projects can directly address inequalities\nof learning, training and employability by putting those with less opportunity to gain the types of skills sought by employers on a more even footing with those who enjoy a more privileged status.\nImproving individual wellbeing and health\nMost people would agree that a successful society is one where economic activity delivers high levels of sustainable wellbeing for\nits citizens. In this context, wellbeing considers how people feel and function, and how they evaluate their lives. By providing opportunities for social contact and enhancing self-esteem, community currencies can contribute significantly to improving personal wellbeing.\nSuch projects offer avenues for socialisation and skill-learning to groups who, to varying degrees, may be excluded from the world of work. In these ways currency schemes can help reduce inequalities arising from high demands on service-provision in low-income areas – a strain that might arise because families with lower incomes have fewer resources to meet their own needs. Higher levels of wellbeing are often associated with positive outcomes such as improved physical health.\nFeeling better\nIndependent evaluation of time-credit schemes run by Spice shows that participants feel fitter, report fewer health problems and visit GPs less often. In 2014, independent impact assessment of Spice found that:\nz 65%ofusersreportedagenerallyimprovedqualityoflife z 45%reportedfeelinghealthier\nz 19%reportedgoingtothedoctorlessfrequently\nThese health benefits are likely knock-on effects of significantly increased levels of community engagement, which helps individuals to feel socially valued and empowered.11\n"

Community currencies can help redistribute power from those who already have it, through wealth or other forms of privilege, to those who don’t.\nSpice Time Credits case study\nCheryl Hughes first earned Ely Time Credits through participating in community projects, getting her whole family involved to earn enough for an upcoming day trip. Participating in these activities helped Cheryl build new relationships and get to know new people locally. She then formed a new group herself: Community Mothers. Cheryl says:\n“Time Credits opened my eyes. I never thought I would be able to do anything other than care for my children because of my dyslexia. It’s helped me gain confidence in myself and improve the way I now live my life.”\nEmpowerment and self-worth come hand in hand, and timebanks and time-based currencies that value a diverse range of skills and knowledge allow both to grow. The voluntary activities facilitated by a currency system enable participants to gain new experiences that offer intrinsic rewards, such as feelings of pride, but are also extrinsically valuable, as the skills they involve are widely applicable in the worlds of paid work and formal education. In this way, currency projects can directly address inequalities\nof learning, training and employability by putting those with less opportunity to gain the types of skills sought by employers on a more even footing with those who enjoy a more privileged status.\nImproving individual wellbeing and health\nMost people would agree that a successful society is one where economic activity delivers high levels of sustainable wellbeing for\nits citizens. In this context, wellbeing considers how people feel and function, and how they evaluate their lives. By providing opportunities for social contact and enhancing self-esteem, community currencies can contribute significantly to improving personal wellbeing.\nSuch projects offer avenues for socialisation and skill-learning to groups who, to varying degrees, may be excluded from the world of work. In these ways currency schemes can help reduce inequalities arising from high demands on service-provision in low-income areas – a strain that might arise because families with lower incomes have fewer resources to meet their own needs. Higher levels of wellbeing are often associated with positive outcomes such as improved physical health.\nFeeling better\nIndependent evaluation of time-credit schemes run by Spice shows that participants feel fitter, report fewer health problems and visit GPs less often. In 2014, independent impact assessment of Spice found that:\nz 65%ofusersreportedagenerallyimprovedqualityoflife z 45%reportedfeelinghealthier\nz 19%reportedgoingtothedoctorlessfrequently\nThese health benefits are likely knock-on effects of significantly increased levels of community engagement, which helps individuals to feel socially valued and empowered.11\n"

Credits can then be traded between individual members – as in a traditional timebank – or spent at various non- profit, public or corporate partners. These currently include cinemas, gyms, family activities and vocational training. Spice also works with the public sector, utilising time-credits to introduce co-production to public services.\nAt both the earning and spending stages, one credit equals one hour of a person’s time or organisation’s services. The Spice system has its historical roots in the Welsh labour movement, when mining communities would contribute part of their wage to both support and access mutually owned local services, such as clinics, workingmen’s clubs and libraries."
