But the fact that these pollutants are often invisible – and even when they can be seen (or smelled) are hard to track to their source – impedes efforts by communities to reclaim their right to a healthy and safe environment.\n\nCommunity-based environmental justice advocates across the country want and need to know what pollutants from which corporate facilities are affecting their communities, and what other communities across the country are impacted by the same corporations. This information can be a potent tool for empowering citizens to address environmental concerns that directly affect their health and their families.\n\nSocially responsible investors want and need information on corporate environmental performance, including the quantity and toxicity of emissions, numbers of people affected, and the extent of disproportionate impacts on low-income communities and people of color. This information can be a crucial input in efforts to engage corporations to address environmental problems locally and nationally."
