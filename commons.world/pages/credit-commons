We might also despair at how entrenched this worldview is amongst the elites who decide these things often it seems, in their interests rather than the majority.\nMany things are happening and many alternatives are being proposed and tried. Bitcoin’s release shortly after the financial crisis in 2008 created a vibrant new discourse around disintermediating banks, open payment protocols, and the nature of money itself. Bitcoin has many problems and isn’t really a solution, but our collective learning from it has been huge. This paper proposes a new bottom up monetary infrastructure, the Credit Commons, which already exists in fragments, and better reflects and supports the values and structures of the ‘solidarity economy’\nThe suggestion is not principally that ‘we’ can ‘change’ the money system and hence the economy, although there is some truth to that. But more importantly to point out that such a thing as a ‘solidarity economy’ cannot be built on the current globalised debt-money system; and the kind of money needed for a more beautiful world can be assembled without permission of states, without legal force, and without high running costs."

This a convenient measure for the government because it directly correlates with taxation, but it also in practice corresponds to the rate of resource extraction and CO2 emissions. If and when economic growth does not keep pace with interest repayment demands, the issuance of new debt lags behind debt repayments and the volume of money decreases, stalling the economy. Since 2008 bank lending to productive enterprise has slowed as banks use increasingly cheap money not to re-lend as the government begs them, but to shore up the titanic holes in their balance sheets, which, if officially acknowledged would mean the whole banking sector was insolvent. The real economy is being sacrificed to cover previous reckless profiteering of the financial sector."

By turns they are doing both: cutting social spending in order to pay off debts, and increasing debt by injecting new money into bank balance sheets in the hope that banks will lend money into circulation. Interest rates have been lowered to near zero to enable or encourage ever greater borrowing. Overall public debts are still increasing which makes nonsense out of the austerity narrative. Only when we understand that money can be something other than commercial credit can we see ways out of the dilemma, the most obvious of which is to contain bank lending and have government issue ‘sovereign’ money instead which is how most people still think money is issued."

Oil, steel and other commodity prices have fallen dramatically in 2015, and with the revaluation of the Yuan in the summer, it became evident that not even Chinese growth could not offset the global slowdown. All developed economies have followed Japan into the deflationary trap; the only way out that we know is from out 1930s experience, when the threat and reality of WWII lead to massive borrowing and full employment, otherwise permanent recession.\nDeflation means that more money is being paid back to banks than is being borrowed from banks. When this ‘debt’ money is repaid, it cancels out on the bank’s balance sheet and no longer exists. The amount of money (circulating) in the world is going down, which means less employment, less money in people’s pockets, less demand for goods and services, and lower prices."

There are many ways to intervene in markets, with purchasing policies, regulation & policing, price manipulation, capital controls, and of course the full gamut of mafia tactics and dirty tricks.

In the first place, these institutions must promote local creativity and support community initiatives that are organized through solidarity, horizontal and equitable relationships. Second, they must encourage the greatest possible circulation of money at the local level. This means attracting locally generated surpluses and making them circulate as many times as possible within the local space, thus increasing the multiplier effect of a given level of deposits and savings. Third, these institutions must adjust themselves so that the savers, or the generators of surpluses, may decide on the use of their resources, thus allowing for a greater transparency in the relationship between saver and investor that may, in turn, promote greater participation in activities devoted to making development alternatives in the local space more viable. Fourth, these financial institutions must be managed in a cooperative way by people in the community itself, which means that the management should also be local in origin. Finally, if the local financial institution is to gain credibility, it must be protected against any potential liquidity crisis.\nWho among us even knows how to build a financial institution? Before that we need to re-learn how to trust and cooperate, how to give and receive, how to put down our own projects to move further, faster with others’. "

And in a very practical sense, if not in a legal one, we do own they money in our pockets. But most money is not in the form of cash but in the form of bank deposits, which is something else entirely. As with money, we need to know who has the right to create bank deposits, and who gives value to bank deposits, by what law banks are allowed to subtract them from our accounts, and how transaction charges can be so high 6 years since the invention of blockchains. Bank deposits behave much less like a commodity than money - it is created from nothing as a liability, it is always owned by the bank and can only move within a legally defined infrastructure. The balance in my account is merely the promise of the bank to give me cash if it is able, and if it wants to. The 97% of modern money which is bank deposits is privately owned in the sense that it is issued at the discretion of, at a price determined by, and for the profit of, private banking institutions.\nBut banks do not only store money and earn rent on credit issued ex nihilo. Banks also perform the other function of money which is making payments, and earn vast sums from doing so. Moving money is as simple as debiting one account and crediting another. We can see how this works in Western Union where cash is paid in office and paid out of another office in another country moments later. It is clear the actual money wasn’t transferred between franchise outlets, only the promise of it. All banking networks and within banks are working with these promises, of money, of gold, of other promises."

      "text": "# 3.2    Ledger money\nWe have seen above a kind of virtual money which exists on a ledger as the imbalance between accounts. There is no money, zero, in the ledger, but only account balances going up and down, their total always being zero.\nLedgers in banks and other corporations are used to store promises of real money, because it is easier to track and transport promises than cash. The intention is always to settle the balance at a later date with a single net payment; sometimes settlement is not even necessary if the net balance is close to zero. Sometimes these systems are said to provide liquidity because they allow payments without cash.\nA ledger used in this way, is called a credit clearing system. Before computers, all the cheques paid into the banks in one day would go to the clearing house where they would be added up and cancelled out. Banks would pay each other only the difference. Clearing means much the same even today: the hassle of moving actual money can be reduced insofar as transactions can be cleared beforehand, and this is precisely what ledgers do. And payment need never be made as long as accounts stay within a tolerable trustworthy distance of zero.\nConventional bank deposits are created on a balance sheet, thus as property, but on a ledger the payments between accounts are more like flows, or even relationships.\nLedger money is not minted or printed, it has no physical form and no fixed quantity. Starting from zero, Alice can pay Bob 10 units. Then Alice’s account is -10 and Bob’s +10. The total is zero. Bob can pay Carol, and Carol, Alice. When Alice’s balance is back to zero she can walk away, having paid and been paid without the hassle of shipping units back and forth in armoured vehicles.\nAnother way of looking at it is that spending and earning the internal currency units simultaneously creates and destroys ‘money’ such that, by definition there is always the right amount of it to represent the current credit/debit relationships.\nAlice’s having ‘owed’ the system for some time is not counted a debt and need not produce interest. In order for Bob to receive widgets before he paid widgets, someone else had to pay before they received. This is a reciprocal relationship and totally different from the commodity money paradigm in which the wealthy own all the money (or at least the right to promise what they don’t have) and rent it out to the poor. And let us not forget that what is really valuable here is not the money, but the goods and services flowing in the opposite direction!\nLedger money fulfils two of the three classical functions of money: the medium of exchange and the unit of account; but not the store of value function. Economists such as Silvio Gesell argued strongly that ‘money’ should not be intended as a long term store of value since the primary properties of money are its liquidity and virtuality. The store of value function should be performed by commodities or securitised commodities, and to expect money to perform all three functions is an error of thinking.\n"

      "text": "# 3.3    Mutual credit economics\nUsing a ledger in this way, as a closed system with accounts extending credit to each other, is sometimes called mutual credit. This term focuses not so much on the clearing aspect, but on the fact that credit can be made available to anyone at any time, and the risk entailed by that credit is spread out across the whole system. In the event of an account being abandoned rather than being closed at zero, the whole system deviates from the perfect zero, and all members are affected equally when the total supply and total demand leave equilibrium.\nThis notion of economic equilibrium is a guiding principle of a mutual credit economy, and not of the global economy which is a competition to accumulate the most. Another word for economic equilibrium, is exchange, because parties give and receive in equal measure. When giving exactly equals receiving, the account balance is zero and only then may the account be closed. Since all accounts have agreed to close on zero, after Alice has paid Bob ten units, Alice is looking to earn 10 units and Bob is looking to spend ten units; thus supply equals demand. In a fiat or commodity money system, the governors, if they care, must use voodoo to calculate how much money to put into circulation for optimal trading without inflation, without bubbles, and without unemployment. In a mutual credit system this is a non-question. The political question then becomes, how much can people be trusted to deviate from zero and still return?\nThe further away a balance is from zero, the greater the risk that that account will fail to reciprocate. If no deviation were allowed there would be no liquidity and no trade. If infinite deviation was allowed, some players would only ever give and others only take. We observed earlier that supply always equals demand. Every force has an equal and opposite force. When accounts are hovering around their limits, struggling to reciprocate, that means there is equal and opposite pressure elsewhere in the system.\nA well-managed system will be able to mitigate these pressures by paying attention to those accounts and making it easier for them to trade back in the right direction.\nA poorly managed system may be lucky if negative failures to return to zero cancel out positive failures - defaults can be in either direction.\nOnce the design problem of how credit should be allocated is decided, perhaps by the people whose credit it is, which is everybody, then as much credit can be created as needed.\nAny system can of course have tweaks and redistributive mechanisms, but the fundamental properties are still important. Commodity money must be earned (or borrowed at interest) before it can be spent; the more of it you have, the better it is for you, though that might mean others are deprived. Those who have a scarce commodity (money), get more from renting it out. The day to day governance of such instruments is done through interest rate manipulation and taxing/spending, but the flagrant injustices of this paradigm are never fully mitigated by social security and other forms of redistribution.\nUsually some accounts have difficulty earning as much as they would like to spend and vice versa. Because these problems can affect the whole system, the whole system has an incentive to support those accounts, either by trading with them preferentially, redistributing credit or coming to some other arrangement. This mutual support is visible for what it is, not welfare bleeding out of the pay-packets of the people who actually work, but enabling everyone to both give and receive, which is essential for the health of the whole system.\nIt is well understood how spending locally can create a multiplier effect, and all local currencies seek to strengthen and make visible that virtuous circle. In that sense, a local currency can build solidarity within the local economy insofar as it actually diverts spending towards the local economy, which is a very difficult thing to measure.\nBut there is a deeper solidarity within a mutual credit system than within the multitude of Euro proxies which have sprung up in recent years. The value of the system depends on the engagement of the members and the quality of their experiences, which is the subject of the third paper in this series. The wealth gains that come from good governance, a glut of production and the wellbeing of the precarious members are spread around much more in a mutual credit system than in a commodity money system, where all the wealth gains are sent to the top of the pyramid as rents are adjusted.\nAll of which is why mutual credit is the money of the solidarity economy.\n"

      "text": "# 3.4    Mutual credit in the real world\nAt the post WWII Bretton Woods conference, Keynes proposed that international trade be conducted through a country-to-country mutual credit system called the Bancor. The conference initially agreed the idea was sound and just, but then the USA unilaterally squashed the idea with a dollar/gold standard, then defaulted on their obligations and created the petrodollar system. Today few alternatives are discussed but the idea of going to back to the bancor has been mooted.\nThis is especially significant for an economy experiencing deflation - a scarcity of circulating money. The act of one account extending trust to another account to enable it to participate in a ‘split barter’ exchange can be seen as an act which creates liquidity. While ledgers are used throughout the financial world, there are much fewer examples of ledgers being used without the intention ever to settle, which is to say to settle debts through reciprocal exchange rather than money changing hands. \nThe most prominent is surely the business barter industry which helps businesses move unsold stock and get bums on otherwise empty seats, \nfollowed by the LETS movement which encourages the middle classes to meet each other and save money together. (French SEL, German Tauschkreis)\nfinally timebanking, in which poor and excluded people are given opportunities to support each other and build confidence. \nAt present a great many of these systems are poorly governed from a credit perspective and have a poor understanding of how mutual credit is supposed to work. Regulation within the business barter industry fails to prevent the owners of exchanges running up a deficit, which means buying all the best stuff and flooding the members with credit, and then never earning that credit back. Similar things happen in LETS and timebanks, but usually not for personal gain.\nThis has the effect that credit accumulates in members’ accounts and they want to spend, but the corresponding debit is not looking to earn. Thus the marketplace has more buyers than sellers and very often barter dollars change hands at less than parity with US dollars; inflation in these systems is a sure sign of poor governance. Bartercard national franchises do this routinely, I understand, but since their accounts are private, their innocence or guilt cannot be established.\nWhen the same things happens in LETS and timebanks, it matters much less because members depend less on these systems and are more forgiving. The governing board may decide to issue some credit to express the collective intention of the community, say to organise a festival, and the units may not be collected back in tax or entrance fees. The party account may stay negative forever and the corresponding units may slosh around creating a net positive balance in all the other accounts. Then someone might die with an equivalent positive balance and unwittingly the equilibrium is restored.\nI have heard members of business barter systems report that it didn’t work for them, never quite sure why it was so much easier to earn than spend the barter credit, members of LETS and Time banks almost always have positive experiences, often despite poor fiscal governance! The reason is because a mutual credit accounting system, accompanied by a directory of goods and services, exists to enable exchange and yields positive, productive relationships by the way. In contrast, the legal tender economy forces producers compete globally for every dollar or face poverty and shame languishing on the heap of the unemployed.\nMany members report feeling that this ledger money is easier to earn and less painful to give - it unlocks generosity.\n\n\f\n"

I hope to explore the details below.\nThere have been a great many local exchange platforms created in the last few years but no sharing of code and certainly no interoperability between them. Teams who want to facilitate community exchange have given all their effort to building custom software and not enough to re-usable software and not enough to building community.\nSee the appendix for a condensed list of community exchange platforms none of which are interoperable and many of which have failed to thrive owing to lack of uptake. \nNote that while the credit commons itself is proposed to be a mutual credit system, any type of currency could participate. All that is required of a candidate member is an account for import/export and trust from existing members that the candidate will return to zero.\nThis section discusses some of the design parameters of a mutual credit federation.\n4.1    Legal Structure\nThere are pros and cons to using formal structures. For example managing a bank account in the name of an association is easier and more trusted than someone’s personal account. My vision of the credit commons is an informal association, accountable only to its members, which does not handle money at all. This is how Bitcoin works. There is no association but anyone can install some free software and just plug into the network. Later the Bitcoin Foundation was created to help grow Bitcoin but many users didn’t regard the foundation as legitimate.\nBy contrast the credit commons would embody a similar libertarian ethic, but instead of being an open system without trust, it would consist of private groups who may or may or not trust each other. Thus anyone could open an account in a credit commons, but only trusted people and groups could exchange. In this arrangement I see no benefit to registering the credit commons as an organisation, since no money should change hands and no legal recourse is needed between trusted parties.\n"

      "text": "# 4.2    Governance\nThe most important governance question in a mutual credit system is to manage risk on behalf of all the members by determining the extent to which accounts can deviate from zero. Within a scarcity worldview, it is much more important to manage the negative limit both because members fear losing out and because there is more incentive to take without giving.\nSince the credit is mutually guaranteed by all member groups and by extension, all members of all member groups, it is critical that at least this part of the governing process be participative. The same principle applies in the legal tender economy, but there is no acknowledgement that it is workers who give value to money and risk management is done by banks only to maximise their profits and losses.\nAlso credit must be allocated as far as possible on a case-by-case basis. Banks are increasingly automating loan applications using algorithms, and while this is good for profits it does not serve entrepreneurs. The way to process credit applications more quickly is not through automation, but through the kind of aggregation we see in microcredit, where a loan request must be guaranteed by several people. In the credit commons a whole community would apply for credit from the collective of communities, and that community would guarantee that credit.\nThe governing process has other responsibilities, as in any community money system: managing relations and especially disputes between communities, monitoring communities who may be struggling with their balance of trade; recruiting new members, managing public perception.\nGovernance could be done by volunteers, or compensated volunteers. Any tax and any ‘wages’ could only be denominated in credit for goods and services.\nThere might be a centralised brokering service to stimulate trade, and that brokering might be paid for with taxes or transaction fees. Alternatively brokering could be done by private individuals who could earn commission, in credit.\n"

Those groups are private and voluntary associations of individuals who may invite others to join them. Thus newcomers could not automatically join a private group but could form their own group. There could be many networks there which are not connected at all and there could be hierarchies of groups. For example all the time banks in UK could form a group to manage hours liquidity amongst themselves and Timebanks UK could be part of another group of all the national timebanking associations, also using the same unit of account, hours, which is the defining feature of timebanking.\nAt each level of organisation there would need to be a governing process comprising all its members.\nSimilarly the business barter networks could have their own arrangements in the same credit commons without touching timebanking, or as long as exchange rate mechanism is agreed, it could touch timebanking.\nThus payments from user to another might be registered at several levels depending how far in network space, the payment is going. A payment to a timebank in another country would have to obey the balance limits of both groups concerned at each level.\nThe concept of nesting credit clearing systems has also been discussed in the International Journal of Complementary Currency research\n"

      "text": "# 4.4    Exchange rate mechanisms & balance limits\nThe impossible trinity applies equally to credit commons economies as to national economies:\nThe Impossible trinity (also known as the Trilemma) is a trilemma in international economics which states that it is impossible to have all three of the following at the same time:\nA stable foreign exchange rate\nFree capital movement (absence of capital controls)\nAn independent monetary policy. \nSince the credit commons is a tool for distributing political power and issuance of credit to the local level, independent monetary policy is not negotiable. A stable foreign exchange rate is maintained by curbing imports and exports, which is to say, balancing exports and imports. This gives every community an incentive to produce if wants to import and to spend if it wants to export. The designers of the Euro would have done well to apply such an ethic. Furthermore, speculation and price manipulation of currencies is contained according to the proportion of each community’s credit which is allowed to circulate outside its own accounts.\nThe post gold-standard FOREX system of currency exchange is a free market; this design has a self correcting mechanism which helps to keep prices stable. As the price of a currency deviates from its actual purchasing power, the price of goods and services in that country becomes distorted in a way that attracts trade in the opposite direction. For example, if a currency is undervalued, that country’s exports become cheaper, and demand for them increases, which drives up the currency price. This tendency towards stability is desirable in the credit commons.\nBut within that framework, it is possible for a community with a sovereign monetary policy, to stabilise its own prices using credit/debit allocated for that purpose. This is perfectly sound practice as long as the limits are respected. All communities are allowed to issue credit/debit and can use it equally for liquidity with other communities or for stabilising their own currency. In the case of fraud, damage would be limited only according to how much trust had been allocated to the rogue community, and would not be contagious.\nIn small scale systems the precise exchange rate matters much less. The largest community currency system has been running 15 years using exchange rates fixed a long time ago, and had no issues.\nThe question remains then, as explained above, how balance limits are decided between member exchanges. Greater balance limits mean greater risk, which is to say greater impact in case of failure to return to zero. Each group should decide its own process/formula through a political process. Limits should be imposed by a custom script or plugin in the accounting software and not set in stone. There are plenty of examples from which to take inspiration.\nIn the banking system it is normal to grant individuals overdrafts up to two months of salary without asking too many questions. Larger loans, for commerce and business startups, need to be scrutinised by the bank which has a mandate to be risk averse.\nEvery business barter network has its own formula or process for allocating credit, which usually takes into account the desirability of the applicants produce and their trading volume.\nWithin LETS, there are many theories about how balance limits should be determined. Typically a minimum limit is given to new members, which increases proportionately with volume of trade. \nBOX: In Western Austria 'talents' were flowing from a rural Tauschkreis to a nearby urban one and both systems on were stuck on their respective limits and in danger of freezing. They put their heads together and organised a rural festival and bussed in the city folk to spend their talents back and restore the balance.\n\n"

In this way of thinking, members are property to be owned, before they are customers to be served!\nThis way also causes problems because the software providers assume that each exchanges barter dollars are worth the same without checking the integrity of the exchanges, which all to often are suffering from a profligate house account.\nThe International Reciprocal Trade Organisation sought to improve the situation by introducing another currency governed by itself, called Universal Currency. The system is its own platform and thus members have the experience of being in two exchanges and using two currencies. In 2014 the system ran into liquidity problems and fraud allegations followed. The system has now been rebooted in partnership with Bartercard, but it is not clear that the governance problems were addressed.\n4.5.2    LETS\nIn the 1990s there were several attempts to make accounting software for LETS using databases on local machines. The most valiant attempt at intertrading using Access was in Scotland where everyone was using a well developed MS Access application called SAM. The LETS of LETS was held in a separate instance of SAM and transactions were communicated by email.\nAround 2003 CES arrived, a web service allowing LETS to have their own web site in which members managed their own accounts rather than processing cheques communicating by post. CES grew quickly when it offered an intertrading mechanism between exchanges. A fixed exchange rate was calculated according to the national currency and the time-value of each exchanges unit, and this persists to this day.\nThe author of this document and CTO of Community Forge attempted to improve the CES system with an open API and in 2012 but the task was too onerous.\nSeveral LETS around Zurich are networked together with a semi automatic system which requires they all use the same platform.\n4.5.3    Timebanking\nTimebanking software has always been much more centralised than LETS being produced by the national associations rather than the communities themselves. Thus all the timebanking platforms, sharing a unit of account have enjoyed a high degree of interoperability.\nThe initial USA and UK systems were poorly built and managed and eventually both gave way to a free, well run, but closed source platform which now hosts several hundred timebanks. This means those timebanks are interoperable in theory but so far no policy exists to manage trading limits and no API to include software hosted elsewhere.\n\n\n\f\n"

      "text": "# 5    Natural analogies\n5.1    A biomimicry perspective\nThis section was co-authored with Jamie Brown-Hansen.\nThe field of biomimicry is, among other things, a way of doing biology that looks for unifying patterns in the design of natural systems. There is enormous diversity in the natural world, yet biologists are able to identify certain design strategies that are common across multiple species and even kingdoms of species. Some of the deepest design patterns, in fact, can be recognised in almost all biological systems at every scale, from bacteria to multicellular organisms to entire ecosystems. These unifying patterns are referred to within the biomimicry community as Life’s Principles. They represent a design framework that has delivered thriving, regenerative systems in the natural world for 3.8 billion years, a proven recipe for long-term success within the operating conditions of this planet that we can apply where relevant in the effort to achieve sustainable human systems, including our systems of exchange.\nThe proposal of the credit commons is consistent with many of nature’s core unifying design patterns: it is bottom-up, locally attuned and adapted, diverse, decentralised, iterative, modular, and premised on quantitative stability over time. The interconnection of community-based mutual credit systems is also endorsed by the Bio-credits Working Group of the Biomimicry Global Network in answer to the question, “How would nature design a financial system?” The remainder of this section draws out some specific characteristics of the credit commons proposal that are consistent with natural system design.\n5.1.1 Locally attuned and adapted\nIn the natural world, chances of survival improve when organisms are well adapted and responsive to local conditions around them. Similarly, after decades of policy experimentation and experience, sustainable development strategists have learned that the most appropriate prescriptions for human development in any given region are attuned and adapted to local context. In the conventional bank credit system innovations in system design are templated first at the global level and make their way down to national level implementation thereafter, often without further adaptation to the contexts of individual communities.\nSome measures have shown strong correlations with good econometric outcomes across the board, such as investments in health, education and women. However, some experiences of standardised policy prescriptions applied to countries irrespective of local context have also been catastrophic. For example after the 2008 financial crisis, a committee in Basel required that banks to increase their capital requirements, which lead to a wave of debt-related suicides amongst farmers in India.\nThe credit commons starts with local innovation by communities themselves, attuned and adapted to their particular context and needs.\n5.1.2 Bottom-up development combining modular and nested components\nLiving systems assemble components one unit at a time, with development starting at the smallest scale. Simple solutions to a basic problem are nested within larger systems to form more complex entities. Starting with simple building blocks moving to more complex allows all the parts of the new system to grow and develop in response to local contexts, from the bottom up. This recalls the biological metaphor of cohabiting cells working together to form a multicellular organism. A cell is a (comparatively) simple entity and a life form in its own right. Biology gives us many examples of cells working together and specialising to make an organism with a higher degree of organisation.\nThe credit commons proposes that the economy be re-imagined from the bottom up in a self-organised manner analogous to the design process of the natural world. The power of the state to force citizens to accept its promises as money is anathema to notions of freedom of persons, and of markets. Considering the value of legal tender monies rests entirely on the productivity of the citizens, they are the natural candidates to issue promises for produce, if money be such. Systems in which a currency is imposed from the above lead to disparities in the availability of the currency, as we see in the Eurozone between Germany and Greece, for example. The biomimetic principle of designing from the bottom up would suggest every person, or more likely every economy, have its own currency for internal trade, and that complexity and scale be layered on top of that stable system.\n5.1.3    Embody resilience through systemic diversity and decentralisation \nClose to the principle of building from the bottom up is the principle of decentralisation. Many centres increases the resilience of the whole system, because it reduces dependences and single points of failure. Natural systems maintain function following disturbance by incorporating a variety of duplicate forms, processes, or systems that are not located exclusively together. \nThe Biomimicry Resource Handbook explains: “Resilience is the capacity of a system to maintain function following a disturbance. In short, it is the ability to recover after adversity. The capacity for resiliency, from bodily organs to ecosystems, often depends on the interconnectedness and functional diversity of multiple systems. When one system fails or does poorly, others can step in to compensate, either briefly or long term. As the nature of the disturbance is unpredictable, variation in strategies allows for some to endure while others may be lost. Redundancy permits the remaining to continue despite losing some, and decentralisation ensures that independent of where the disturbance falls, not all components will be subject to its impacts.”\nThe credit commons can be understood as a permaculture landscape of diverse local models interacting with each other, analogous to a natural ecosystem. A variety of locally attuned credit modules interacting in dynamic non-equilibrium is a more resilient structure than the metaphorical monoculture of today’s prevailing monetary system, according to former central banker, Bernard Lietaer.\n5.1.4    Protective membranes regulating in/out\nIn modern economies the balance of trade figure reveals how much value a country is gaining or losing. It is obtained by measuring the flow of the national currency across borders. It is very hard to obtain this figure for local or regional economies which use the same currency as their neighbours. With much more localised currencies, this figure can tell us a lot about microeconomic health and activity. Each member of a mutual credit network has a maximum extent to which its balance can deviate from zero. These limits function like a membrane of a cell, revealing the value going in and out to the wider system. In economic terms a balance-of-trade indicator is built in to each economy and the health and needs of each economy becomes visible. Limits can be set by local economy AND by the higher order system and the lowest limits respected. This affords local economies a level of protection against strong inflows or outflows of credit which would cause inflation/deflation and distort the value of their currency.\nAs the localities join together to form bioregions, and bioregions to form countries, transactions which have to pass between more balance limits, and more cultural barriers, become more cumbersome and probably more expensive. In this way the credit commons architecture favours localised exchange.\n5.1.5    Fractal design\nAs we have shown, clearing systems can be nested, with one clearing system having an account in a meta system. Smaller local modules are nested within larger regional modules, with the pattern repeated up to the global scale. This is consistent with the pattern of system design in the natural world from microorganism to biosphere. Moreover, not only are facilities in the credit commons modular and nested, they are also iterative. In other words, the same principles of organisation and engagement can be applied at each system level. This is analogous to patterns of fractal design in the nature world. \nFor example, in order for a mutual credit facility to function, all participants must agree to the principle of balanced mutual exchange. In other words, they agree to give and receive equally over the course of their membership in the credit community. Concretely, this can mean, for example, that participants must start with a balance of zero, and end with a balance of zero. This principle applies not just to individual participants in a local credit community, but also to local communities participating in a regional credit facility, and so on up to the global level. In the case of a regional facility, each local community agrees to balance its imports and exports in order to participate; the same principle applied at the next level.\n\nWe would suggest around 4 levels of nesting ranging from local systems to bioregional systems, to national or linguistic regions, to a world clearing system. This allows the same mechanism to serve at all scales of the economy and probably provides a bias towards more local trade, since currencies are more valuable nearer to where they can be spent. \n5.2    Money as flows in a field\nIt is tempting when exploring the True nature of money, as theologians study the bread in the Eucharist, to study the tokens and the exchanges. One popular approach is to posit a substance called 'value' which resides in the tokens, either intrinsically because the tokens are made of some valuable stuff (use value), or by government decree (exchange value). This is reminiscent of the theory of transubstantiation in which the bread somehow 'changes' into into the body of Christ.\nBut this whole approach assumes that money is some kind of stuff which moves from hand to hand. Even fiat money is a commodity insofar as it is valued for itself more than for what it can buy.\nWhen we look at the different ways of issuing money, we see clearly that 97% of modern money is NOT a commodity. It comes from nothing and exists only on bank balance sheets. This is accounting money, the kind used in mutual credit systems. And it has some other interesting properties:\nFor every unit of money created as a liability, there is a corresponding asset created with equal and opposite value\nThe money flows into circulation and at the appointed time some money - not necessarily the same money is pulled out of circulation and cancelled out against the asset, leaving nothing.\nWhen we look at cash we might imagine each piece moves around the economy independently of other money, like a ball bouncing randomly around a pinball machine. But with accounting money you can't mark the bills and track one piece of money just like you can't pinpoint an electron. A better analogy is a field.\nIt turns out that money is very like energy. By studying the substance we miss the wood for the trees. The paradox of money-as-a-commodity and money-as-a-promise is resolved once money is regarded as a circuit or as a wave acting in a field. It is created when no-value splits into assets and liabilities, just like when a neutral photon breaks into a positron and an electron which go spinning off in different directions and times. Money can be seen like electrons leaping from atom to atom, but look at the whole picture and money flows like a wave in a field, pushing waves before it and pulling waves behind it. What matters is not the atoms or the leaping, but the integrity and balance of the circuit. \nAt least, that's when it works.\nWhen we treat money as a commodity, the flows get out of sync. When we hoard money and relend the same money twice we prevent it from returning to source. When we just read the peaks and not the troughs, we miss the coming tsunami.\nWhen, for cultural reasons, borrowers take all the responsibility and risk, while lenders charge rent on their absent 'property' the two parties will never dance well together, leading to gluts and dearths and arhythmia.\nCredit money, or accounting money is very much like electricity, and the conceptual leap if we want master it is the same leap as from Newtonian mechanics to Quantum mechanics.\n\n\n\f\n"

      "text": "# Conclusion\nThere are no reliable statistics, but since the financial system transitioned into the realm of fiction in 2008, the present author has witnessed a noticeable growth in complementary currency activities. The LETS have been declining since at least the turn of the century. Time banking has benefitted from institutional support and more favourable legal rulings, and there are several projects which fit neither family. I judge that the success rate of currency projects remains very low. This is because most complementary currencies are started by an isolated enthusiast, but they can only succeed when many people actively participate. Awareness that money itself may not be a neutral commodity is certainly growing, but that understanding is a long way from making a conscious decision to invest effort in the local economy, and to do so outside of legal tender money.\nIt will be argued therefore, that the very notion of a local economy is so eroded in a global society, and money itself so aspatial, and local money systems so lacklustre that there is nothing to federate.\nBut it can also be argued that a credit commons would strengthen all the local systems, giving them new uses and wider relevance. Local currencies would undoubtedly be more useful if they could be spent in other localities. In addition, the process of making local systems interoperable will increase awareness about how money systems could be run, and what is possible once we learn to cooperate.\nFinally, human architectures of exchange may be better positioned to serve as an organ of planetary ecology, fostering global conditions conducive to biological life, if their patterns of development are consistent with the bottom-up pattern of systems innovation in the natural world. The consistency of design principles can allow human and natural systems to flow more seamlessly together so that “the city can no longer be distinguished from the forest” from a systems design perspective. \nEnough open source software already exists (some created by the author of this document) for local communities to design and own local exchanges.

We might also despair at how entrenched this worldview is amongst the elites who decide these things often it seems, in their interests rather than the majority.\nMany things are happening and many alternatives are being proposed and tried. Bitcoin’s release shortly after the financial crisis in 2008 created a vibrant new discourse around disintermediating banks, open payment protocols, and the nature of money itself. Bitcoin has many problems and isn’t really a solution, but our collective learning from it has been huge. This paper proposes a new bottom up monetary infrastructure, the Credit Commons, which already exists in fragments, and better reflects and supports the values and structures of the ‘solidarity economy’\nThe suggestion is not principally that ‘we’ can ‘change’ the money system and hence the economy, although there is some truth to that. But more importantly to point out that such a thing as a ‘solidarity economy’ cannot be built on the current globalised debt-money system; and the kind of money needed for a more beautiful world can be assembled without permission of states, without legal force, and without high running costs.\nThe Credit Commons allows for a multitude of alternative or experimental models to coexist. It puts the credit issuing power in the hands of value creators. There are many existing micro-economies which could easily plug in using an open protocol and open source tools.\nIn economics as in sex, there is nothing new under the sun. The credit commons draws on many intellectual precedents (though this is not a history paper) to revive ideas and principles neglected the main stream.  This paper touches on speculation-proof currency, payment without money, money as a relationship rather than a commodity, ecological design, and aspires to a financial system founded on radical principles like voluntary participation and reciprocal trust.\nThis is the first of 3 proposed papers. The second will explore technical implementations, and the third, a socio-technical approach.\nGlossary\nBitcoin. The first blockchain application and decentralised digital currency. Many libertarians hoped the new technology would disintermediate the banking system and force a correction of many flaws in the money system.\nBlockchain. A blockchain is a database stored across many servers, which maintains data integrity of the data. Open blockchains have clever ways to do this without having to trust any given node, but there are also permissioned blockchains which trust all nominated nodes. \nClearing. The process of cancelling out debts owed between multiple parties. Clearing can be continuous, or it can be a precursor to ‘settlement’ which means paying the outstanding debts with money or something of value.\nCommunity. The members of an exchange.\nCryptocurrency: Any currency which uses a blockchain for its ledger.\nExchange. A group of people who exchange and keep accounts with a ledger. \nLETS. Local exchange trading system. A model for community exchange formulated by Michael Linton, which spread mostly through the middle classes in developed countries the late 1980s and 1990s. Characterised by the use of a ledger plus a directory of members’ offers and needs.\nLedger. A definitive list of payments between accounts, starting with all accounts on zero.\nLocal currency. A specific design of local currency in which attractive pieces of paper with a legal tender face value are sold for that legal tender, which is held in reserve.\nMutual Credit. Closed circle accounting in which the sum of all account balances is necessarily zero. It implies a money system is like a cell with a border and an inner life. This contrasts with more open systems of money which allow the unit of account itself to be hoarded out of circulation and make scarce.\nPayment. Normally this means settling a debt by giving something of value but the meaning becomes blurred when the value of money of questioned or when [banks’] promises to pay money are regarded as good as money itself. So payment can simply mean registering a transaction in a ledger.\nQuantitive Easing (QE) a type of monetary policy used by central banks to stimulate the economy when standard monetary policy has become ineffective. A central bank implements quantitative easing by buying financial assets from commercial banks and other financial institutions, thus raising the prices of those financial assets and lowering their yield, while simultaneously increasing the money supply.\nRails. A ledger seen as a payment router. Ledgers can be networked together for greater coverage.\nRent. Money taken not from productive work but from property owned and lent to someone who needs it.\nSolidarity economy. A general term used to describe the growing numbers of businesses and nonprofits who create economic value but use other metrics of success than monetary profit, and other models of ownership than private property. The word ‘solidarity’ stands in contrast with the competitive ethic which some perceive to be implicit in ‘capitalism’.\nTime bank. A local exchange system which uses hours as the unit of account. Formulated by Edgar Cahn, many governments support timebanking as a ‘social inclusion’ mechanism, and there are national associations in USA, UK, Israel, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere. Many community groups call themselves time banks but have no ties with national organisations.\n\n\n\n1.     Economic & social context\n1.1    Financial crisis without end\nGlobal credit expansion of the magnitude which commenced under Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher and which continues to this day is premised on indefinite economic growth, which is defined as an increase in Gross Domestic Product, or the amount of money changing hands. This a convenient measure for the government because it directly correlates with taxation, but it also in practice corresponds to the rate of resource extraction and CO2 emissions. If and when economic growth does not keep pace with interest repayment demands, the issuance of new debt lags behind debt repayments and the volume of money decreases, stalling the economy. Since 2008 bank lending to productive enterprise has slowed as banks use increasingly cheap money not to re-lend as the government begs them, but to shore up the titanic holes in their balance sheets, which, if officially acknowledged would mean the whole banking sector was insolvent. The real economy is being sacrificed to cover previous reckless profiteering of the financial sector.\nGovernments have only two possible and opposing responses. By turns they are doing both: cutting social spending in order to pay off debts, and increasing debt by injecting new money into bank balance sheets in the hope that banks will lend money into circulation. Interest rates have been lowered to near zero to enable or encourage ever greater borrowing. Overall public debts are still increasing which makes nonsense out of the austerity narrative. Only when we understand that money can be something other than commercial credit can we see ways out of the dilemma, the most obvious of which is to contain bank lending and have government issue ‘sovereign’ money instead which is how most people still think money is issued.\nPerhaps because of the large number of big bank shareholders in and around government, or perhaps because the economics profession has mostly abandoned all approaches except ‘neo-classical’ economics, issuing sovereign money is unthinkable. Many other sensible and obvious economic policies also receive no serious consideration, such as clamping down on use of tax havens, reducing military spending or taxing imports, issuing sovereign money, bailing out the people, inflating away the debt, nationalising too-big-to-fail institutions to name but a few. \nQE may have raised prices of stocks & commodities, and food, but this was offset by very low interest rates and it looks like massive global deleveraging is taking place. Oil, steel and other commodity prices have fallen dramatically in 2015, and with the revaluation of the Yuan in the summer, it became evident that not even Chinese growth could not offset the global slowdown. All developed economies have followed Japan into the deflationary trap; the only way out that we know is from out 1930s experience, when the threat and reality of WWII lead to massive borrowing and full employment, otherwise permanent recession.\nDeflation means that more money is being paid back to banks than is being borrowed from banks. When this ‘debt’ money is repaid, it cancels out on the bank’s balance sheet and no longer exists. The amount of money (circulating) in the world is going down, which means less employment, less money in people’s pockets, less demand for goods and services, and lower prices.\n\nAs interest rates start to dip below zero, there will be a need to prevent people hoarding cash, so banks are waging a propaganda #waroncash in favour of high tech all-digital total-surveillance payments. This would at least have the effect of damping the social unrest which ensues from injustice at such scale. \nModern economies are very much controlled from above, traditionally by government policy but increasingly by 'markets', a euphemism for the combined interests of the largest corporations, many of them financial. There are many ways to intervene in markets, with purchasing policies, regulation & policing, price manipulation, capital controls, and of course the full gamut of mafia tactics and dirty tricks. But perhaps the single most influential way of controlling a whole economy is by throttling its access to credit, a power which now lies exclusively with the banking sector, since quantitative easing has less and less effect.\nIt is no wonder that ordinary people surveying the global economy in hope of a better life for their children can see all the abundance and all the poverty, all the marginalised ideas and all the intransigence and ideology, turn on the TV just for distraction. \nBut before moving on, I want to offer a follow-the-money analysis, an approach which rarely fails to yield insights. This notion of credit control being a single choke-point on the economy, and the fact of this power lying in the hands of entities which debt makes psychopathic and insatiable, seems to be lost on most theorists and commentators; but consider the power of the financial sector:\nIt has enormous holdings and influence all sectors of the economy such as media (propaganda), technology, security, food, health, international relations.\nIt can lend unlimited money, channel it towards certain sectors or companies, set interest rates.\nIt is guaranteed solvency by the taxpayer and immunity to criminal law justified by the too-big-to-fail dogma which says that the success of these banks is less damaging than their failure.\nIt has unlimited budget for lobbying, access to revolving doors and a great many of its shareholders in government posts.\nBy financing the economics profession it has made alternatives to neoclassical economics unthinkable despite repeated crises.\nWith all its data and data-mining capacity, it know us intimately.\nWhile the White House, the deep state, Israel, the Military Industrial Complex and other institutions surely bear responsibility for many of our problems, the greatest single concentration of power must surely be placed in the global banking cartel and its abuse of the money power.\n1.2    Popular responses to the economic malaise\nFrom the 19th Century we still have cooperatives and mutual benefit societies, some of which are thriving. The expression ‘solidarity economy’ emerged from South America and has spread to Europe, and it describes that subset of institutions which value things other than profit. In Spain the integral cooperatives are growing. Also Europe has an degrowth movement with an annual conference. In USA the Italian slow food initiative has been augmented with a slow money initiative. In Austria there is the Economy for the Common Good movement in which businesses audit themselves using a tool similar to triple bottom line accounting.\nFortunately the Great Recession seems to have fueled a range of other discourses which are rarely presented in the mainstream media. \nThere has been a renewed interest in simpler more transparent, more direct financial services. The Move Your Money campaign saw an encouraging movement out of banks and into credit unions but seemingly not enough to have systemic impact. Many social startups and government sponsored experiments are vying to revolutionise finance, investment, and payments with new models such as crowdfunding things banks won’t fund, and peer-to-peer lending which cuts out the bank as an intermediary.\nSuch new financial services could point the way towards a new economy with less speculation and rent-collecting intermediaries, but they do nothing for the present crisis in which money issued as interest bearing debt is draining out of circulation as new loans are less than repayments.\nBitcoin seemed to offer a democratisation of money with a ledger which could not be hacked, new coins being issued to those who invested in securing the network, the possibility of privacy in transactions, and low transaction charges. But the many benefits have not offset other concerns: price instability, the punitive legal judgements, fear-mongering in the financial press, and latterly serious governance issues. Having been designed as a sort of digital gold, Bitcoin suffers from many of the same flaws as gold-money. Any money-as-commodity is vulnerable to hoarding, speculation and throttling by the wealthiest players in the market.\nRachel O’Dwyer puts it more forcefully\n\"It would seem that Bitcoin, far from representing a monetary commons, is instead an ideal financial asset for rent-seeking capitalism. Because of its design there is also no possibility for cheap credit in the Bitcoin system and if the unit matures, a banking system will be necessary to provide credit based on deposits.\"\nBitcoin’s market capitalisation represents nearly $5bn (November 2015) of a new highly liquid commodity. This is a drop in the ocean of quantitative easing, and its lack of circulation means Bitcoin as money is not really mitigating the crisis.\n\nTransition towns and ecovillages across Europe are increasingly aware of the importance of economic development to their wider goals. This movement wide awakening only translates into a small number of dedicated individuals, and the legal, & software tools they need barely yet exist.\nMany local organisations, especially in France, have created their own local currencies. Most of these are 'backed' by legal tender, which means they may serve to nudge shoppers into local procurement, but they neither increase liquidity nor transfer legitimacy from criminal institutions to trusted sources of credit/money.\nIf all this gives grounds for hope I would like to temper it by observing two things which have held true since the roman empire:\ntechnological unemployment means that there is less and less human effort needed to sustain life. This would be a good thing if opportunities to work (or at least to benefit from the work machines do) were properly distributed.\nthe wealthiest people have access to unlimited money and credit with which to buy, out-invest or undercut any competition\nHowever productive the workers are, rent always increases commensurately confiscating much of the wealth created. Despite many rags-to-riches tales of social mobility, most productive people will never control the wealth they produce unless they first own the means of production, and ultimately the land which brings food sovereignty.\nFew solutions then, are recognising the power and role of banks or addressing the (economic) root causes of poverty. We may seek political solutions, but we also need to find ways to withdraw our patronage en masse. \nIn section two we will look in more detail at bank-money and how banks control the main function of money, payments. \n1.3     Resourcing the solidarity economy\nFor many years, impassioned activists have been making reasonable arguments about the need for a Green New Deal, or pointing out how the Military industrial complex does not increase the security of ordinary people.\nBut no argument seems to divert the constant flow of money towards what Buckminster Fuller called life-sustaining projects from war, bureaucracy, decadence, and propping up insolvent banks. Governments who used to provide essential infrastructure now expect private companies to build everything with private capital. Private capital flows on the basis of profitability alone, its dearth of ethics being applauded by neoliberal fundamentalists.\nThe assumption that the market will meet all needs, means the ones who can’t even get to the market are discounted, left to charities and do-gooders. Similarly environmental, spiritual, cultural, and humanitarian projects with no intention to make a profit are regarded as marginal, more so in an economic ‘downturn’. \nThe situation is further hindered by laws which prevent the unemployed from volunteering, and nonprofits from taking unpaid volunteers.\nNot to deny the importance of money, many organisations are failing to tap into a wealth of resources lying idle in their communities. Pensioners, lonely and bored, people on sick pay who can work but maybe not take responsibility, and even unemployed could be engaged discreetly. What is lacking is the organisation to put volunteers in useful work the emotional hooks to motivate them, and the means to reward volunteers, whether it be a sense of ownership or entitlement, or the ability to access goods and services.\nIn short, as the formal economy shrinks, valuable labour and all kinds of resources are left idle as need grows. The solidarity economy can grow by matching the unmet needs and unused resources, which is one of the core messages of timebanking. Insofar as money is NOT used, producers own their produce, and need submit neither accounts nor tax returns, nor repay debt nor comply with all kinds of legislation.\nWe have some examples, some templates and tools, mostly not very modern, of what such an economy can look like. The cooperative movement has been huge. Great solidarity is witnessed in the aftermath of natural disasters. There are ecovillages, social enterprises, charity also has a role to play. But all the pieces are scattered\nTo conclude this section I invite you to consider Chilean economist Manfred Max Neef’s vision of a bottom up financial system:\nThe financial institutions that may be concerned with local financing of Human Scale Development must state goals and forms of operation going far beyond conventional principles. In the first place, these institutions must promote local creativity and support community initiatives that are organized through solidarity, horizontal and equitable relationships. Second, they must encourage the greatest possible circulation of money at the local level. This means attracting locally generated surpluses and making them circulate as many times as possible within the local space, thus increasing the multiplier effect of a given level of deposits and savings. Third, these institutions must adjust themselves so that the savers, or the generators of surpluses, may decide on the use of their resources, thus allowing for a greater transparency in the relationship between saver and investor that may, in turn, promote greater participation in activities devoted to making development alternatives in the local space more viable. Fourth, these financial institutions must be managed in a cooperative way by people in the community itself, which means that the management should also be local in origin. Finally, if the local financial institution is to gain credibility, it must be protected against any potential liquidity crisis.\nWho among us even knows how to build a financial institution? Before that we need to re-learn how to trust and cooperate, how to give and receive, how to put down our own projects to move further, faster with others’. \n\f\n2    Understanding payments infrastructure\n2.1     Ledgers and rails\nThe coins jangling in our pockets and the paper furled in our wallets, feel to their bearers like a commodity which can be exchanged for other commodities, as if they had value-in-themselves. And in a very practical sense, if not in a legal one, we do own they money in our pockets. But most money is not in the form of cash but in the form of bank deposits, which is something else entirely. As with money, we need to know who has the right to create bank deposits, and who gives value to bank deposits, by what law banks are allowed to subtract them from our accounts, and how transaction charges can be so high 6 years since the invention of blockchains. Bank deposits behave much less like a commodity than money - it is created from nothing as a liability, it is always owned by the bank and can only move within a legally defined infrastructure. The balance in my account is merely the promise of the bank to give me cash if it is able, and if it wants to. The 97% of modern money which is bank deposits is privately owned in the sense that it is issued at the discretion of, at a price determined by, and for the profit of, private banking institutions.\nBut banks do not only store money and earn rent on credit issued ex nihilo. Banks also perform the other function of money which is making payments, and earn vast sums from doing so. Moving money is as simple as debiting one account and crediting another. We can see how this works in Western Union where cash is paid in office and paid out of another office in another country moments later. It is clear the actual money wasn’t transferred between franchise outlets, only the promise of it. All banking networks and within banks are working with these promises, of money, of gold, of other promises.\nNote that a ledger entry does not cause real money to change hands. The ledger’s unit of account is a virtual money or a promise to pay ‘real money’. For that reason, in banking, ‘pay’ means the same as ‘promise to pay’ or ‘transfer a promise to pay’.\nA ledger, in the sense that I mean it, is merely a list of transactions between accounts. Because every transaction is a subtraction from one account and an addition to another, the sum of all accounts must necessarily be zero, thus a ledger has a sort of built-in integrity.\nA ledger records payments between accounts by simply adding a line. The money, or the promise can by definition only be in one place at one time. There is no duplication possible. Whether the ledger is on paper, on a single spreadsheet, or in a single table database it is integral in a way that two ledgers might not be.\nBetween accounts in one ledger, payments take place instantaneously and definitively. A ledger is often likened to a railway network in which carriages flow easily between endpoints. But this is only as useful as the ledger is large. Each bank keeps its own ledger but payments between banks and between countries present a technical challenge of ensuring the integrity of the accounts. Payments must be certain to ‘leave’ one ledger and enter another despite typically running on different computers with different software and different owners. And there needs to be an audit trail. There must be no chance of payments derailing and not arriving, or of payments arriving without leaving anywhere!\nStrong technology and legal oversight exists to ensure sure that both organisations’ auditors agree on the accounts and that promises were not lost or duplicated as they streamed from ledger to ledger and from database to database and from network to network, and that everything is reported to the authorities.\nThe obvious solution is ledger of ledgers, which only banks can connect to and in many cases is owed by a cooperative of those banks, such as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, SWIFT.\nNeedless to say, banking rails which are plugged into the global financial network are tightly controlled and expensive.\nThat is why banks regard their rails as private property and charge rent for the use of them.\n2.2    Monopolies and blockchains\n\"Whoever controls the data centre exercises political and economic control over communications. It’s difficult to see how we can counteract these recentralising tendencies in order to build a common core infrastructure... barriers include the age-old problem of scaling distributed forms of organisation beyond the local\"\nIt is important to note that a ledger has to be owned and someone had to be trusted to maintain the ledger with integrity. A ledger owner has the power to move money between accounts, to inspect, edit, delete, deny and crucially, siphon off transaction fees (or any charges).\nMany thinkers believe that certain types of infrastructure should be excluded from the realm of competition because the duplication of those services creates huge complexities and inefficiencies. Those services, they argue, should be run by the state. But this reasoning went to the wall in the ongoing orgy of privatisation started in the 1980s. The notion of rails reminds Englishmen of the British Rail, a natural monopoly owned by the government which was privatised by ruling ideologues in the 1990s. There were price rises, safety concerns, large profits, and even now station staff can often find better prices than the computerised booking system. But I would point out that even in the midst of this farce, the rails were still managed by one company, Railtrack.\nI know of no Western government which owns its payment rails outside the postal service. This critical infrastructure is almost all owned by private corporations. This ‘natural’ cartel would have us believe that the only way to move ‘money’ is to own or rent the rails from payer to payee. Many small, specialist and startup payments companies with no rails of their own pay to piggy-back on the rails of one of these corporations because building another set of rails would be prohibitively expensive.\nThe Islamic system of Hawala takes a different approach. Instead of infrastructure to guarantee the system integrity, hawala relies on trust and the personal reputations of the agents at either end. This has the unfortunate consequence of avoiding any rails, transaction charges and surveillance, which has put this ancient low-tech system on the wrong side of post 9/11 anti-money-laundering laws dictated to the world by the US banking system jealous of our privacy.\n2.3    A note on Bitcoin\nAll I’ve said until now should help to explain the disruptive potential of blockchain technologies. Its success would mean the obviation of whole payments cartel. \nThe Bitcoin infrastructure is not owned, but is a de-facto commons. This raises difficult questions about governance, which became a serious problem when a fork, Bitcoin XT was proposed. Decisions in Bitcoin are taken democratically, not with one person/one vote, but one miner/one vote. The owners of the mining machines are not representative of all Bitcoin’s stakeholders. The major dilemma in the community is now whether to develop the system towards greater adoption by complying with regulation, or to continue in the legal grey areas but upholding libertarian ideals.\nThere is much confusion in the cryptocurrency discourse about the decentralisation of money and payments. All cryptocurrencies are built on a singleton ledger which is distributed across many machines. A single ledger is a point of centralisation, as is a single currency, even if there are many copies of the ledger in a distributed data architecture. Advocates of economic and financial decentralisation are very pleased to have witnessed the arrival of blockchain technologies, but cannot celebrate all the focus on a single currency with a single issuance policy (or algorithm) on a singleton ledger. Many have envisaged a multi-currency marketplace with cryptocurrencies freely competing, thus allowing for a deeper decentralisation, but progress in this direction is as slow as uptake of those alt-currencies, almost none of which have any basis for being valuable, (such as a commodity backing or legal pronouncement) nor could compete with Bitcoin in any meaningful way.\n\n\n\f\n3. Towards a monetary commons\nRachel O'Dwyer attempts to define a monetary commons thus:\n\"what we’re talking about isn’t just the implementation of a complementary currency that is held and produced in common, or the widespread re-appropriation of the production of money, but a monetary design that specifically supports forms of social and material reproduction. For example this includes health, education, and care services and from a monetary perspective, a Universal Basic Income and/or access to inexpensive credit.\"\nThere are several ideas here which would make fascinating exploration but I would like to offer a more distilled definition based on the widely held understanding that 97% of existing ‘money’ is in fact bank deposits. As we have seen, money feels to its user like property and in that sense it can be held and managed collectively. But with a deeper understanding we can see that to really own our money, we must be able to issue it and control the payments infrastructure.\nCreating a global payments infrastructure is however easy with blockchains. But creating an institution which has the right to promise money it doesn’t have, typically requires putting down a deposit of $50m before a single brick has been laid. Small banks may not be commercially viable. Then the right to issue money is highly regulated, and paying to accounts in other banks necessarily involves using other rails. So this approach could produce useful results, if done with the right intentions. The ‘ethical banks’ are small and risk-averse, limited by the amount held on deposit, and they find it hard to lend to the most worthwhile projects.\nThis paper proposes something much more radical.\nAs long as we believe the story of ‘legal tender’ we will be at the mercy of those who write the law. Legal tender, and promises to pay legal tender are highly regulated. Government give themselves the right to define money on behalf of the people, then they spend, tax, monitor, order debts be discharged in, and surveil that money. Furthermore a bank’s promise to pay legal tender can be used completely interchangeably with legal tender itself, even for payment of taxes, even if the bank is insolvent! Although legal tender is supposed to be a way that a government can issue money from nothing, accountable to parliament according to the needs of the economy, it no longer serves the economy but only the banks. Control over the quantity of money has passed to the banks who now issue 97% of it, and not to serve the economy but to maximise rent income in the form of interest.\nIt could be that there is no way to reform this system, to make it serve the real economy, to bring it back under democratic control. It could be that if we want a money system that that serves value creators rather than value extractors, unleashes potential rather than enslaving it, and which expresses the collective intention, we will need to start from scratch.\n3.1    Currency value & taxability\nWhen money is ‘backed’ that means that the issuer guarantees to exchange it for a commodity at a predetermined price. The money is in effect a warehouse receipt for, say 1 twenty-fifth of an ounce of gold. This has the effect of anchoring the value of the currency to the value of the backing commodity, which inspires confidence where it may otherwise be lacking. Most of the current wave of local currencies are backed by legal tender.\nA currency’s backing is very important to establish the legal status and also the value of a currency. If a currency can be priced unequivocally in dollars, transactions will be taxed at the dollar rate. This is entirely appropriate for a business which is doing barter as a way to get better prices of free liquidity but which otherwise measures its profit in dollars.\nIf there is no convertibility to dollars governments step beyond their philosophical remit (this is just my opinion; I’ve never heard a government attempt to justify its actions or its existence philosophically). Rather than tax the money changing hands, guidelines around LETS taxation indicate that professional work itself should be taxed, at the going rate. So I could unblock the sink of an old lady for LETS no problem, but a plumber would have to declare the work done and pay tax on the normal callout charge. It starts to get absurd. What if the plumber invoiced a nominal amount, or charged no LETS at all, or registered an unwritten favour?\nIs it legal to give my labour to a friend instead of selling it for money? Does government claim ownership of everything of value we produce? Does government determine the value everything using its own legal tender as a measure? Is any life or property possible without money being demanded from people under threat of force? This is a legal grey area that needs to be explored.\n3.2    Ledger money\nWe have seen above a kind of virtual money which exists on a ledger as the imbalance between accounts. There is no money, zero, in the ledger, but only account balances going up and down, their total always being zero.\nLedgers in banks and other corporations are used to store promises of real money, because it is easier to track and transport promises than cash. The intention is always to settle the balance at a later date with a single net payment; sometimes settlement is not even necessary if the net balance is close to zero. Sometimes these systems are said to provide liquidity because they allow payments without cash.\nA ledger used in this way, is called a credit clearing system. Before computers, all the cheques paid into the banks in one day would go to the clearing house where they would be added up and cancelled out. Banks would pay each other only the difference. Clearing means much the same even today: the hassle of moving actual money can be reduced insofar as transactions can be cleared beforehand, and this is precisely what ledgers do. And payment need never be made as long as accounts stay within a tolerable trustworthy distance of zero.\nConventional bank deposits are created on a balance sheet, thus as property, but on a ledger the payments between accounts are more like flows, or even relationships.\nLedger money is not minted or printed, it has no physical form and no fixed quantity. Starting from zero, Alice can pay Bob 10 units. Then Alice’s account is -10 and Bob’s +10. The total is zero. Bob can pay Carol, and Carol, Alice. When Alice’s balance is back to zero she can walk away, having paid and been paid without the hassle of shipping units back and forth in armoured vehicles.\nAnother way of looking at it is that spending and earning the internal currency units simultaneously creates and destroys ‘money’ such that, by definition there is always the right amount of it to represent the current credit/debit relationships.\nAlice’s having ‘owed’ the system for some time is not counted a debt and need not produce interest. In order for Bob to receive widgets before he paid widgets, someone else had to pay before they received. This is a reciprocal relationship and totally different from the commodity money paradigm in which the wealthy own all the money (or at least the right to promise what they don’t have) and rent it out to the poor. And let us not forget that what is really valuable here is not the money, but the goods and services flowing in the opposite direction!\nLedger money fulfils two of the three classical functions of money: the medium of exchange and the unit of account; but not the store of value function. Economists such as Silvio Gesell argued strongly that ‘money’ should not be intended as a long term store of value since the primary properties of money are its liquidity and virtuality. The store of value function should be performed by commodities or securitised commodities, and to expect money to perform all three functions is an error of thinking.\n3.3    Mutual credit economics\nUsing a ledger in this way, as a closed system with accounts extending credit to each other, is sometimes called mutual credit. This term focuses not so much on the clearing aspect, but on the fact that credit can be made available to anyone at any time, and the risk entailed by that credit is spread out across the whole system. In the event of an account being abandoned rather than being closed at zero, the whole system deviates from the perfect zero, and all members are affected equally when the total supply and total demand leave equilibrium.\nThis notion of economic equilibrium is a guiding principle of a mutual credit economy, and not of the global economy which is a competition to accumulate the most. Another word for economic equilibrium, is exchange, because parties give and receive in equal measure. When giving exactly equals receiving, the account balance is zero and only then may the account be closed. Since all accounts have agreed to close on zero, after Alice has paid Bob ten units, Alice is looking to earn 10 units and Bob is looking to spend ten units; thus supply equals demand. In a fiat or commodity money system, the governors, if they care, must use voodoo to calculate how much money to put into circulation for optimal trading without inflation, without bubbles, and without unemployment. In a mutual credit system this is a non-question. The political question then becomes, how much can people be trusted to deviate from zero and still return?\nThe further away a balance is from zero, the greater the risk that that account will fail to reciprocate. If no deviation were allowed there would be no liquidity and no trade. If infinite deviation was allowed, some players would only ever give and others only take. We observed earlier that supply always equals demand. Every force has an equal and opposite force. When accounts are hovering around their limits, struggling to reciprocate, that means there is equal and opposite pressure elsewhere in the system.\nA well-managed system will be able to mitigate these pressures by paying attention to those accounts and making it easier for them to trade back in the right direction.\nA poorly managed system may be lucky if negative failures to return to zero cancel out positive failures - defaults can be in either direction.\nOnce the design problem of how credit should be allocated is decided, perhaps by the people whose credit it is, which is everybody, then as much credit can be created as needed.\nAny system can of course have tweaks and redistributive mechanisms, but the fundamental properties are still important. Commodity money must be earned (or borrowed at interest) before it can be spent; the more of it you have, the better it is for you, though that might mean others are deprived. Those who have a scarce commodity (money), get more from renting it out. The day to day governance of such instruments is done through interest rate manipulation and taxing/spending, but the flagrant injustices of this paradigm are never fully mitigated by social security and other forms of redistribution.\nUsually some accounts have difficulty earning as much as they would like to spend and vice versa. Because these problems can affect the whole system, the whole system has an incentive to support those accounts, either by trading with them preferentially, redistributing credit or coming to some other arrangement. This mutual support is visible for what it is, not welfare bleeding out of the pay-packets of the people who actually work, but enabling everyone to both give and receive, which is essential for the health of the whole system.\nIt is well understood how spending locally can create a multiplier effect, and all local currencies seek to strengthen and make visible that virtuous circle. In that sense, a local currency can build solidarity within the local economy insofar as it actually diverts spending towards the local economy, which is a very difficult thing to measure.\nBut there is a deeper solidarity within a mutual credit system than within the multitude of Euro proxies which have sprung up in recent years. The value of the system depends on the engagement of the members and the quality of their experiences, which is the subject of the third paper in this series. The wealth gains that come from good governance, a glut of production and the wellbeing of the precarious members are spread around much more in a mutual credit system than in a commodity money system, where all the wealth gains are sent to the top of the pyramid as rents are adjusted.\nAll of which is why mutual credit is the money of the solidarity economy.\n3.4    Mutual credit in the real world\nAt the post WWII Bretton Woods conference, Keynes proposed that international trade be conducted through a country-to-country mutual credit system called the Bancor. The conference initially agreed the idea was sound and just, but then the USA unilaterally squashed the idea with a dollar/gold standard, then defaulted on their obligations and created the petrodollar system. Today few alternatives are discussed but the idea of going to back to the bancor has been mooted.\nThis is especially significant for an economy experiencing deflation - a scarcity of circulating money. The act of one account extending trust to another account to enable it to participate in a ‘split barter’ exchange can be seen as an act which creates liquidity. While ledgers are used throughout the financial world, there are much fewer examples of ledgers being used without the intention ever to settle, which is to say to settle debts through reciprocal exchange rather than money changing hands. \nThe most prominent is surely the business barter industry which helps businesses move unsold stock and get bums on otherwise empty seats, \nfollowed by the LETS movement which encourages the middle classes to meet each other and save money together. (French SEL, German Tauschkreis)\nfinally timebanking, in which poor and excluded people are given opportunities to support each other and build confidence. \nAt present a great many of these systems are poorly governed from a credit perspective and have a poor understanding of how mutual credit is supposed to work. Regulation within the business barter industry fails to prevent the owners of exchanges running up a deficit, which means buying all the best stuff and flooding the members with credit, and then never earning that credit back. Similar things happen in LETS and timebanks, but usually not for personal gain.\nThis has the effect that credit accumulates in members’ accounts and they want to spend, but the corresponding debit is not looking to earn. Thus the marketplace has more buyers than sellers and very often barter dollars change hands at less than parity with US dollars; inflation in these systems is a sure sign of poor governance. Bartercard national franchises do this routinely, I understand, but since their accounts are private, their innocence or guilt cannot be established.\nWhen the same things happens in LETS and timebanks, it matters much less because members depend less on these systems and are more forgiving. The governing board may decide to issue some credit to express the collective intention of the community, say to organise a festival, and the units may not be collected back in tax or entrance fees. The party account may stay negative forever and the corresponding units may slosh around creating a net positive balance in all the other accounts. Then someone might die with an equivalent positive balance and unwittingly the equilibrium is restored.\nI have heard members of business barter systems report that it didn’t work for them, never quite sure why it was so much easier to earn than spend the barter credit, members of LETS and Time banks almost always have positive experiences, often despite poor fiscal governance! The reason is because a mutual credit accounting system, accompanied by a directory of goods and services, exists to enable exchange and yields positive, productive relationships by the way. In contrast, the legal tender economy forces producers compete globally for every dollar or face poverty and shame languishing on the heap of the unemployed.\nMany members report feeling that this ledger money is easier to earn and less painful to give - it unlocks generosity.\n\n\f\n4    Federating local currencies\nThe credit commons is the notion, perhaps first voiced by Tom Greco, that local ledgers should be connected together using public infrastructure rails, with each currency retaining control of its own issuance and balance of trade, but governed cooperatively. I hope to explore the details below.\nThere have been a great many local exchange platforms created in the last few years but no sharing of code and certainly no interoperability between them. Teams who want to facilitate community exchange have given all their effort to building custom software and not enough to re-usable software and not enough to building community.\nSee the appendix for a condensed list of community exchange platforms none of which are interoperable and many of which have failed to thrive owing to lack of uptake. \nNote that while the credit commons itself is proposed to be a mutual credit system, any type of currency could participate. All that is required of a candidate member is an account for import/export and trust from existing members that the candidate will return to zero.\nThis section discusses some of the design parameters of a mutual credit federation.\n4.1    Legal Structure\nThere are pros and cons to using formal structures. For example managing a bank account in the name of an association is easier and more trusted than someone’s personal account. My vision of the credit commons is an informal association, accountable only to its members, which does not handle money at all. This is how Bitcoin works. There is no association but anyone can install some free software and just plug into the network. Later the Bitcoin Foundation was created to help grow Bitcoin but many users didn’t regard the foundation as legitimate.\nBy contrast the credit commons would embody a similar libertarian ethic, but instead of being an open system without trust, it would consist of private groups who may or may or not trust each other. Thus anyone could open an account in a credit commons, but only trusted people and groups could exchange. In this arrangement I see no benefit to registering the credit commons as an organisation, since no money should change hands and no legal recourse is needed between trusted parties.\n4.2    Governance\nThe most important governance question in a mutual credit system is to manage risk on behalf of all the members by determining the extent to which accounts can deviate from zero. Within a scarcity worldview, it is much more important to manage the negative limit both because members fear losing out and because there is more incentive to take without giving.\nSince the credit is mutually guaranteed by all member groups and by extension, all members of all member groups, it is critical that at least this part of the governing process be participative. The same principle applies in the legal tender economy, but there is no acknowledgement that it is workers who give value to money and risk management is done by banks only to maximise their profits and losses.\nAlso credit must be allocated as far as possible on a case-by-case basis. Banks are increasingly automating loan applications using algorithms, and while this is good for profits it does not serve entrepreneurs. The way to process credit applications more quickly is not through automation, but through the kind of aggregation we see in microcredit, where a loan request must be guaranteed by several people. In the credit commons a whole community would apply for credit from the collective of communities, and that community would guarantee that credit.\nThe governing process has other responsibilities, as in any community money system: managing relations and especially disputes between communities, monitoring communities who may be struggling with their balance of trade; recruiting new members, managing public perception.\nGovernance could be done by volunteers, or compensated volunteers. Any tax and any ‘wages’ could only be denominated in credit for goods and services.\nThere might be a centralised brokering service to stimulate trade, and that brokering might be paid for with taxes or transaction fees. Alternatively brokering could be done by private individuals who could earn commission, in credit.\n4.3    Nesting\nThe credit commons is an open infrastructure for community currency groups to make multilateral exchange agreements. Those groups are private and voluntary associations of individuals who may invite others to join them. Thus newcomers could not automatically join a private group but could form their own group. There could be many networks there which are not connected at all and there could be hierarchies of groups. For example all the time banks in UK could form a group to manage hours liquidity amongst themselves and Timebanks UK could be part of another group of all the national timebanking associations, also using the same unit of account, hours, which is the defining feature of timebanking.\nAt each level of organisation there would need to be a governing process comprising all its members.\nSimilarly the business barter networks could have their own arrangements in the same credit commons without touching timebanking, or as long as exchange rate mechanism is agreed, it could touch timebanking.\nThus payments from user to another might be registered at several levels depending how far in network space, the payment is going. A payment to a timebank in another country would have to obey the balance limits of both groups concerned at each level.\nThe concept of nesting credit clearing systems has also been discussed in the International Journal of Complementary Currency research\n4.4    Exchange rate mechanisms & balance limits\nThe impossible trinity applies equally to credit commons economies as to national economies:\nThe Impossible trinity (also known as the Trilemma) is a trilemma in international economics which states that it is impossible to have all three of the following at the same time:\nA stable foreign exchange rate\nFree capital movement (absence of capital controls)\nAn independent monetary policy. \nSince the credit commons is a tool for distributing political power and issuance of credit to the local level, independent monetary policy is not negotiable. A stable foreign exchange rate is maintained by curbing imports and exports, which is to say, balancing exports and imports. This gives every community an incentive to produce if wants to import and to spend if it wants to export. The designers of the Euro would have done well to apply such an ethic. Furthermore, speculation and price manipulation of currencies is contained according to the proportion of each community’s credit which is allowed to circulate outside its own accounts.\nThe post gold-standard FOREX system of currency exchange is a free market; this design has a self correcting mechanism which helps to keep prices stable. As the price of a currency deviates from its actual purchasing power, the price of goods and services in that country becomes distorted in a way that attracts trade in the opposite direction. For example, if a currency is undervalued, that country’s exports become cheaper, and demand for them increases, which drives up the currency price. This tendency towards stability is desirable in the credit commons.\nBut within that framework, it is possible for a community with a sovereign monetary policy, to stabilise its own prices using credit/debit allocated for that purpose. This is perfectly sound practice as long as the limits are respected. All communities are allowed to issue credit/debit and can use it equally for liquidity with other communities or for stabilising their own currency. In the case of fraud, damage would be limited only according to how much trust had been allocated to the rogue community, and would not be contagious.\nIn small scale systems the precise exchange rate matters much less. The largest community currency system has been running 15 years using exchange rates fixed a long time ago, and had no issues.\nThe question remains then, as explained above, how balance limits are decided between member exchanges. Greater balance limits mean greater risk, which is to say greater impact in case of failure to return to zero. Each group should decide its own process/formula through a political process. Limits should be imposed by a custom script or plugin in the accounting software and not set in stone. There are plenty of examples from which to take inspiration.\nIn the banking system it is normal to grant individuals overdrafts up to two months of salary without asking too many questions. Larger loans, for commerce and business startups, need to be scrutinised by the bank which has a mandate to be risk averse.\nEvery business barter network has its own formula or process for allocating credit, which usually takes into account the desirability of the applicants produce and their trading volume.\nWithin LETS, there are many theories about how balance limits should be determined. Typically a minimum limit is given to new members, which increases proportionately with volume of trade. \nBOX: In Western Austria 'talents' were flowing from a rural Tauschkreis to a nearby urban one and both systems on were stuck on their respective limits and in danger of freezing. They put their heads together and organised a rural festival and bussed in the city folk to spend their talents back and restore the balance.\n\n4.5    Experiences of previous federations\nThe credit commons may be a new formulation, but the federation of local currencies has been attempted many times since the emergence of LETS in the 1980s.\n4.5.1    Business barter\nThe business barter sector has many federations already because this is the business model of the software providers.\nTypically one software is sold to as many exchanges as possible and the vendor takes a dollar commission from each inter-exchange transactions, which seems inappropriate because no dollars change hands and also disincentivises exchange, more so if the fee is high.\nThis model of federation serves the software providers more than the traders because it carves up the marketplace, keeping traders separate according to their exchange’s software choice. In this way of thinking, members are property to be owned, before they are customers to be served!\nThis way also causes problems because the software providers assume that each exchanges barter dollars are worth the same without checking the integrity of the exchanges, which all to often are suffering from a profligate house account.\nThe International Reciprocal Trade Organisation sought to improve the situation by introducing another currency governed by itself, called Universal Currency. The system is its own platform and thus members have the experience of being in two exchanges and using two currencies. In 2014 the system ran into liquidity problems and fraud allegations followed. The system has now been rebooted in partnership with Bartercard, but it is not clear that the governance problems were addressed.\n4.5.2    LETS\nIn the 1990s there were several attempts to make accounting software for LETS using databases on local machines. The most valiant attempt at intertrading using Access was in Scotland where everyone was using a well developed MS Access application called SAM. The LETS of LETS was held in a separate instance of SAM and transactions were communicated by email.\nAround 2003 CES arrived, a web service allowing LETS to have their own web site in which members managed their own accounts rather than processing cheques communicating by post. CES grew quickly when it offered an intertrading mechanism between exchanges. A fixed exchange rate was calculated according to the national currency and the time-value of each exchanges unit, and this persists to this day.\nThe author of this document and CTO of Community Forge attempted to improve the CES system with an open API and in 2012 but the task was too onerous.\nSeveral LETS around Zurich are networked together with a semi automatic system which requires they all use the same platform.\n4.5.3    Timebanking\nTimebanking software has always been much more centralised than LETS being produced by the national associations rather than the communities themselves. Thus all the timebanking platforms, sharing a unit of account have enjoyed a high degree of interoperability.\nThe initial USA and UK systems were poorly built and managed and eventually both gave way to a free, well run, but closed source platform which now hosts several hundred timebanks. This means those timebanks are interoperable in theory but so far no policy exists to manage trading limits and no API to include software hosted elsewhere.\n\n\n\f\n5    Natural analogies\n5.1    A biomimicry perspective\nThis section was co-authored with Jamie Brown-Hansen.\nThe field of biomimicry is, among other things, a way of doing biology that looks for unifying patterns in the design of natural systems. There is enormous diversity in the natural world, yet biologists are able to identify certain design strategies that are common across multiple species and even kingdoms of species. Some of the deepest design patterns, in fact, can be recognised in almost all biological systems at every scale, from bacteria to multicellular organisms to entire ecosystems. These unifying patterns are referred to within the biomimicry community as Life’s Principles. They represent a design framework that has delivered thriving, regenerative systems in the natural world for 3.8 billion years, a proven recipe for long-term success within the operating conditions of this planet that we can apply where relevant in the effort to achieve sustainable human systems, including our systems of exchange.\nThe proposal of the credit commons is consistent with many of nature’s core unifying design patterns: it is bottom-up, locally attuned and adapted, diverse, decentralised, iterative, modular, and premised on quantitative stability over time. The interconnection of community-based mutual credit systems is also endorsed by the Bio-credits Working Group of the Biomimicry Global Network in answer to the question, “How would nature design a financial system?” The remainder of this section draws out some specific characteristics of the credit commons proposal that are consistent with natural system design.\n5.1.1 Locally attuned and adapted\nIn the natural world, chances of survival improve when organisms are well adapted and responsive to local conditions around them. Similarly, after decades of policy experimentation and experience, sustainable development strategists have learned that the most appropriate prescriptions for human development in any given region are attuned and adapted to local context. In the conventional bank credit system innovations in system design are templated first at the global level and make their way down to national level implementation thereafter, often without further adaptation to the contexts of individual communities.\nSome measures have shown strong correlations with good econometric outcomes across the board, such as investments in health, education and women. However, some experiences of standardised policy prescriptions applied to countries irrespective of local context have also been catastrophic. For example after the 2008 financial crisis, a committee in Basel required that banks to increase their capital requirements, which lead to a wave of debt-related suicides amongst farmers in India.\nThe credit commons starts with local innovation by communities themselves, attuned and adapted to their particular context and needs.\n5.1.2 Bottom-up development combining modular and nested components\nLiving systems assemble components one unit at a time, with development starting at the smallest scale. Simple solutions to a basic problem are nested within larger systems to form more complex entities. Starting with simple building blocks moving to more complex allows all the parts of the new system to grow and develop in response to local contexts, from the bottom up. This recalls the biological metaphor of cohabiting cells working together to form a multicellular organism. A cell is a (comparatively) simple entity and a life form in its own right. Biology gives us many examples of cells working together and specialising to make an organism with a higher degree of organisation.\nThe credit commons proposes that the economy be re-imagined from the bottom up in a self-organised manner analogous to the design process of the natural world. The power of the state to force citizens to accept its promises as money is anathema to notions of freedom of persons, and of markets. Considering the value of legal tender monies rests entirely on the productivity of the citizens, they are the natural candidates to issue promises for produce, if money be such. Systems in which a currency is imposed from the above lead to disparities in the availability of the currency, as we see in the Eurozone between Germany and Greece, for example. The biomimetic principle of designing from the bottom up would suggest every person, or more likely every economy, have its own currency for internal trade, and that complexity and scale be layered on top of that stable system.\n5.1.3    Embody resilience through systemic diversity and decentralisation \nClose to the principle of building from the bottom up is the principle of decentralisation. Many centres increases the resilience of the whole system, because it reduces dependences and single points of failure. Natural systems maintain function following disturbance by incorporating a variety of duplicate forms, processes, or systems that are not located exclusively together. \nThe Biomimicry Resource Handbook explains: “Resilience is the capacity of a system to maintain function following a disturbance. In short, it is the ability to recover after adversity. The capacity for resiliency, from bodily organs to ecosystems, often depends on the interconnectedness and functional diversity of multiple systems. When one system fails or does poorly, others can step in to compensate, either briefly or long term. As the nature of the disturbance is unpredictable, variation in strategies allows for some to endure while others may be lost. Redundancy permits the remaining to continue despite losing some, and decentralisation ensures that independent of where the disturbance falls, not all components will be subject to its impacts.”\nThe credit commons can be understood as a permaculture landscape of diverse local models interacting with each other, analogous to a natural ecosystem. A variety of locally attuned credit modules interacting in dynamic non-equilibrium is a more resilient structure than the metaphorical monoculture of today’s prevailing monetary system, according to former central banker, Bernard Lietaer.\n5.1.4    Protective membranes regulating in/out\nIn modern economies the balance of trade figure reveals how much value a country is gaining or losing. It is obtained by measuring the flow of the national currency across borders. It is very hard to obtain this figure for local or regional economies which use the same currency as their neighbours. With much more localised currencies, this figure can tell us a lot about microeconomic health and activity. Each member of a mutual credit network has a maximum extent to which its balance can deviate from zero. These limits function like a membrane of a cell, revealing the value going in and out to the wider system. In economic terms a balance-of-trade indicator is built in to each economy and the health and needs of each economy becomes visible. Limits can be set by local economy AND by the higher order system and the lowest limits respected. This affords local economies a level of protection against strong inflows or outflows of credit which would cause inflation/deflation and distort the value of their currency.\nAs the localities join together to form bioregions, and bioregions to form countries, transactions which have to pass between more balance limits, and more cultural barriers, become more cumbersome and probably more expensive. In this way the credit commons architecture favours localised exchange.\n5.1.5    Fractal design\nAs we have shown, clearing systems can be nested, with one clearing system having an account in a meta system. Smaller local modules are nested within larger regional modules, with the pattern repeated up to the global scale. This is consistent with the pattern of system design in the natural world from microorganism to biosphere. Moreover, not only are facilities in the credit commons modular and nested, they are also iterative. In other words, the same principles of organisation and engagement can be applied at each system level. This is analogous to patterns of fractal design in the nature world. \nFor example, in order for a mutual credit facility to function, all participants must agree to the principle of balanced mutual exchange. In other words, they agree to give and receive equally over the course of their membership in the credit community. Concretely, this can mean, for example, that participants must start with a balance of zero, and end with a balance of zero. This principle applies not just to individual participants in a local credit community, but also to local communities participating in a regional credit facility, and so on up to the global level. In the case of a regional facility, each local community agrees to balance its imports and exports in order to participate; the same principle applied at the next level.\n\nWe would suggest around 4 levels of nesting ranging from local systems to bioregional systems, to national or linguistic regions, to a world clearing system. This allows the same mechanism to serve at all scales of the economy and probably provides a bias towards more local trade, since currencies are more valuable nearer to where they can be spent. \n5.2    Money as flows in a field\nIt is tempting when exploring the True nature of money, as theologians study the bread in the Eucharist, to study the tokens and the exchanges. One popular approach is to posit a substance called 'value' which resides in the tokens, either intrinsically because the tokens are made of some valuable stuff (use value), or by government decree (exchange value). This is reminiscent of the theory of transubstantiation in which the bread somehow 'changes' into into the body of Christ.\nBut this whole approach assumes that money is some kind of stuff which moves from hand to hand. Even fiat money is a commodity insofar as it is valued for itself more than for what it can buy.\nWhen we look at the different ways of issuing money, we see clearly that 97% of modern money is NOT a commodity. It comes from nothing and exists only on bank balance sheets. This is accounting money, the kind used in mutual credit systems. And it has some other interesting properties:\nFor every unit of money created as a liability, there is a corresponding asset created with equal and opposite value\nThe money flows into circulation and at the appointed time some money - not necessarily the same money is pulled out of circulation and cancelled out against the asset, leaving nothing.\nWhen we look at cash we might imagine each piece moves around the economy independently of other money, like a ball bouncing randomly around a pinball machine. But with accounting money you can't mark the bills and track one piece of money just like you can't pinpoint an electron. A better analogy is a field.\nIt turns out that money is very like energy. By studying the substance we miss the wood for the trees. The paradox of money-as-a-commodity and money-as-a-promise is resolved once money is regarded as a circuit or as a wave acting in a field. It is created when no-value splits into assets and liabilities, just like when a neutral photon breaks into a positron and an electron which go spinning off in different directions and times. Money can be seen like electrons leaping from atom to atom, but look at the whole picture and money flows like a wave in a field, pushing waves before it and pulling waves behind it. What matters is not the atoms or the leaping, but the integrity and balance of the circuit. \nAt least, that's when it works.\nWhen we treat money as a commodity, the flows get out of sync. When we hoard money and relend the same money twice we prevent it from returning to source. When we just read the peaks and not the troughs, we miss the coming tsunami.\nWhen, for cultural reasons, borrowers take all the responsibility and risk, while lenders charge rent on their absent 'property' the two parties will never dance well together, leading to gluts and dearths and arhythmia.\nCredit money, or accounting money is very much like electricity, and the conceptual leap if we want master it is the same leap as from Newtonian mechanics to Quantum mechanics.\n\n\n\f\nConclusion\nThere are no reliable statistics, but since the financial system transitioned into the realm of fiction in 2008, the present author has witnessed a noticeable growth in complementary currency activities. The LETS have been declining since at least the turn of the century. Time banking has benefitted from institutional support and more favourable legal rulings, and there are several projects which fit neither family. I judge that the success rate of currency projects remains very low. This is because most complementary currencies are started by an isolated enthusiast, but they can only succeed when many people actively participate. Awareness that money itself may not be a neutral commodity is certainly growing, but that understanding is a long way from making a conscious decision to invest effort in the local economy, and to do so outside of legal tender money.\nIt will be argued therefore, that the very notion of a local economy is so eroded in a global society, and money itself so aspatial, and local money systems so lacklustre that there is nothing to federate.\nBut it can also be argued that a credit commons would strengthen all the local systems, giving them new uses and wider relevance. Local currencies would undoubtedly be more useful if they could be spent in other localities. In addition, the process of making local systems interoperable will increase awareness about how money systems could be run, and what is possible once we learn to cooperate.\nFinally, human architectures of exchange may be better positioned to serve as an organ of planetary ecology, fostering global conditions conducive to biological life, if their patterns of development are consistent with the bottom-up pattern of systems innovation in the natural world. The consistency of design principles can allow human and natural systems to flow more seamlessly together so that “the city can no longer be distinguished from the forest” from a systems design perspective. \nEnough open source software already exists (some created by the author of this document) for local communities to design and own local exchanges. What is needed, I surmise, is \na blockchain protocol, which allows people to organise their promises in the ways described above, and some requirements and explorations will be in the next paper;\nand crucially, to raise awareness of actionable solutions to the monetary paradox and how to implement them for growing numbers of local solidarity groups.\n\n\f\nAppendix A: Table of disconnected community exchange solutions\nThe following table shows a selected list of community exchange initiatives.

We might also despair at how entrenched this worldview is amongst the elites who decide these things often it seems, in their interests rather than the majority.\nMany things are happening and many alternatives are being proposed and tried. Bitcoin’s release shortly after the financial crisis in 2008 created a vibrant new discourse around disintermediating banks, open payment protocols, and the nature of money itself. Bitcoin has many problems and isn’t really a solution, but our collective learning from it has been huge. This paper proposes a new bottom up monetary infrastructure, the Credit Commons, which already exists in fragments, and better reflects and supports the values and structures of the ‘solidarity economy’\nThe suggestion is not principally that ‘we’ can ‘change’ the money system and hence the economy, although there is some truth to that. But more importantly to point out that such a thing as a ‘solidarity economy’ cannot be built on the current globalised debt-money system; and the kind of money needed for a more beautiful world can be assembled without permission of states, without legal force, and without high running costs.\nThe Credit Commons allows for a multitude of alternative or experimental models to coexist. It puts the credit issuing power in the hands of value creators. There are many existing micro-economies which could easily plug in using an open protocol and open source tools.\nIn economics as in sex, there is nothing new under the sun. The credit commons draws on many intellectual precedents (though this is not a history paper) to revive ideas and principles neglected the main stream.  This paper touches on speculation-proof currency, payment without money, money as a relationship rather than a commodity, ecological design, and aspires to a financial system founded on radical principles like voluntary participation and reciprocal trust.\nThis is the first of 3 proposed papers. The second will explore technical implementations, and the third, a socio-technical approach.\nGlossary\nBitcoin. The first blockchain application and decentralised digital currency. Many libertarians hoped the new technology would disintermediate the banking system and force a correction of many flaws in the money system.\nBlockchain. A blockchain is a database stored across many servers, which maintains data integrity of the data. Open blockchains have clever ways to do this without having to trust any given node, but there are also permissioned blockchains which trust all nominated nodes. \nClearing. The process of cancelling out debts owed between multiple parties. Clearing can be continuous, or it can be a precursor to ‘settlement’ which means paying the outstanding debts with money or something of value.\nCommunity. The members of an exchange.\nCryptocurrency: Any currency which uses a blockchain for its ledger.\nExchange. A group of people who exchange and keep accounts with a ledger. \nLETS. Local exchange trading system. A model for community exchange formulated by Michael Linton, which spread mostly through the middle classes in developed countries the late 1980s and 1990s. Characterised by the use of a ledger plus a directory of members’ offers and needs.\nLedger. A definitive list of payments between accounts, starting with all accounts on zero.\nLocal currency. A specific design of local currency in which attractive pieces of paper with a legal tender face value are sold for that legal tender, which is held in reserve.\nMutual Credit. Closed circle accounting in which the sum of all account balances is necessarily zero. It implies a money system is like a cell with a border and an inner life. This contrasts with more open systems of money which allow the unit of account itself to be hoarded out of circulation and make scarce.\nPayment. Normally this means settling a debt by giving something of value but the meaning becomes blurred when the value of money of questioned or when [banks’] promises to pay money are regarded as good as money itself. So payment can simply mean registering a transaction in a ledger.\nQuantitive Easing (QE) a type of monetary policy used by central banks to stimulate the economy when standard monetary policy has become ineffective. A central bank implements quantitative easing by buying financial assets from commercial banks and other financial institutions, thus raising the prices of those financial assets and lowering their yield, while simultaneously increasing the money supply.\nRails. A ledger seen as a payment router. Ledgers can be networked together for greater coverage.\nRent. Money taken not from productive work but from property owned and lent to someone who needs it.\nSolidarity economy. A general term used to describe the growing numbers of businesses and nonprofits who create economic value but use other metrics of success than monetary profit, and other models of ownership than private property. The word ‘solidarity’ stands in contrast with the competitive ethic which some perceive to be implicit in ‘capitalism’.\nTime bank. A local exchange system which uses hours as the unit of account. Formulated by Edgar Cahn, many governments support timebanking as a ‘social inclusion’ mechanism, and there are national associations in USA, UK, Israel, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere. Many community groups call themselves time banks but have no ties with national organisations.\n\n\n\n1.     Economic & social context\n1.1    Financial crisis without end\nGlobal credit expansion of the magnitude which commenced under Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher and which continues to this day is premised on indefinite economic growth, which is defined as an increase in Gross Domestic Product, or the amount of money changing hands. This a convenient measure for the government because it directly correlates with taxation, but it also in practice corresponds to the rate of resource extraction and CO2 emissions. If and when economic growth does not keep pace with interest repayment demands, the issuance of new debt lags behind debt repayments and the volume of money decreases, stalling the economy. Since 2008 bank lending to productive enterprise has slowed as banks use increasingly cheap money not to re-lend as the government begs them, but to shore up the titanic holes in their balance sheets, which, if officially acknowledged would mean the whole banking sector was insolvent. The real economy is being sacrificed to cover previous reckless profiteering of the financial sector.\nGovernments have only two possible and opposing responses. By turns they are doing both: cutting social spending in order to pay off debts, and increasing debt by injecting new money into bank balance sheets in the hope that banks will lend money into circulation. Interest rates have been lowered to near zero to enable or encourage ever greater borrowing. Overall public debts are still increasing which makes nonsense out of the austerity narrative. Only when we understand that money can be something other than commercial credit can we see ways out of the dilemma, the most obvious of which is to contain bank lending and have government issue ‘sovereign’ money instead which is how most people still think money is issued.\nPerhaps because of the large number of big bank shareholders in and around government, or perhaps because the economics profession has mostly abandoned all approaches except ‘neo-classical’ economics, issuing sovereign money is unthinkable. Many other sensible and obvious economic policies also receive no serious consideration, such as clamping down on use of tax havens, reducing military spending or taxing imports, issuing sovereign money, bailing out the people, inflating away the debt, nationalising too-big-to-fail institutions to name but a few. \nQE may have raised prices of stocks & commodities, and food, but this was offset by very low interest rates and it looks like massive global deleveraging is taking place. Oil, steel and other commodity prices have fallen dramatically in 2015, and with the revaluation of the Yuan in the summer, it became evident that not even Chinese growth could not offset the global slowdown. All developed economies have followed Japan into the deflationary trap; the only way out that we know is from out 1930s experience, when the threat and reality of WWII lead to massive borrowing and full employment, otherwise permanent recession.\nDeflation means that more money is being paid back to banks than is being borrowed from banks. When this ‘debt’ money is repaid, it cancels out on the bank’s balance sheet and no longer exists. The amount of money (circulating) in the world is going down, which means less employment, less money in people’s pockets, less demand for goods and services, and lower prices.\n\nAs interest rates start to dip below zero, there will be a need to prevent people hoarding cash, so banks are waging a propaganda #waroncash in favour of high tech all-digital total-surveillance payments. This would at least have the effect of damping the social unrest which ensues from injustice at such scale. \nModern economies are very much controlled from above, traditionally by government policy but increasingly by 'markets', a euphemism for the combined interests of the largest corporations, many of them financial. There are many ways to intervene in markets, with purchasing policies, regulation & policing, price manipulation, capital controls, and of course the full gamut of mafia tactics and dirty tricks. But perhaps the single most influential way of controlling a whole economy is by throttling its access to credit, a power which now lies exclusively with the banking sector, since quantitative easing has less and less effect.\nIt is no wonder that ordinary people surveying the global economy in hope of a better life for their children can see all the abundance and all the poverty, all the marginalised ideas and all the intransigence and ideology, turn on the TV just for distraction. \nBut before moving on, I want to offer a follow-the-money analysis, an approach which rarely fails to yield insights. This notion of credit control being a single choke-point on the economy, and the fact of this power lying in the hands of entities which debt makes psychopathic and insatiable, seems to be lost on most theorists and commentators; but consider the power of the financial sector:\nIt has enormous holdings and influence all sectors of the economy such as media (propaganda), technology, security, food, health, international relations.\nIt can lend unlimited money, channel it towards certain sectors or companies, set interest rates.\nIt is guaranteed solvency by the taxpayer and immunity to criminal law justified by the too-big-to-fail dogma which says that the success of these banks is less damaging than their failure.\nIt has unlimited budget for lobbying, access to revolving doors and a great many of its shareholders in government posts.\nBy financing the economics profession it has made alternatives to neoclassical economics unthinkable despite repeated crises.\nWith all its data and data-mining capacity, it know us intimately.\nWhile the White House, the deep state, Israel, the Military Industrial Complex and other institutions surely bear responsibility for many of our problems, the greatest single concentration of power must surely be placed in the global banking cartel and its abuse of the money power.\n1.2    Popular responses to the economic malaise\nFrom the 19th Century we still have cooperatives and mutual benefit societies, some of which are thriving. The expression ‘solidarity economy’ emerged from South America and has spread to Europe, and it describes that subset of institutions which value things other than profit. In Spain the integral cooperatives are growing. Also Europe has an degrowth movement with an annual conference. In USA the Italian slow food initiative has been augmented with a slow money initiative. In Austria there is the Economy for the Common Good movement in which businesses audit themselves using a tool similar to triple bottom line accounting.\nFortunately the Great Recession seems to have fueled a range of other discourses which are rarely presented in the mainstream media. \nThere has been a renewed interest in simpler more transparent, more direct financial services. The Move Your Money campaign saw an encouraging movement out of banks and into credit unions but seemingly not enough to have systemic impact. Many social startups and government sponsored experiments are vying to revolutionise finance, investment, and payments with new models such as crowdfunding things banks won’t fund, and peer-to-peer lending which cuts out the bank as an intermediary.\nSuch new financial services could point the way towards a new economy with less speculation and rent-collecting intermediaries, but they do nothing for the present crisis in which money issued as interest bearing debt is draining out of circulation as new loans are less than repayments.\nBitcoin seemed to offer a democratisation of money with a ledger which could not be hacked, new coins being issued to those who invested in securing the network, the possibility of privacy in transactions, and low transaction charges. But the many benefits have not offset other concerns: price instability, the punitive legal judgements, fear-mongering in the financial press, and latterly serious governance issues. Having been designed as a sort of digital gold, Bitcoin suffers from many of the same flaws as gold-money. Any money-as-commodity is vulnerable to hoarding, speculation and throttling by the wealthiest players in the market.\nRachel O’Dwyer puts it more forcefully\n\"It would seem that Bitcoin, far from representing a monetary commons, is instead an ideal financial asset for rent-seeking capitalism. Because of its design there is also no possibility for cheap credit in the Bitcoin system and if the unit matures, a banking system will be necessary to provide credit based on deposits.\"\nBitcoin’s market capitalisation represents nearly $5bn (November 2015) of a new highly liquid commodity. This is a drop in the ocean of quantitative easing, and its lack of circulation means Bitcoin as money is not really mitigating the crisis.\n\nTransition towns and ecovillages across Europe are increasingly aware of the importance of economic development to their wider goals. This movement wide awakening only translates into a small number of dedicated individuals, and the legal, & software tools they need barely yet exist.\nMany local organisations, especially in France, have created their own local currencies. Most of these are 'backed' by legal tender, which means they may serve to nudge shoppers into local procurement, but they neither increase liquidity nor transfer legitimacy from criminal institutions to trusted sources of credit/money.\nIf all this gives grounds for hope I would like to temper it by observing two things which have held true since the roman empire:\ntechnological unemployment means that there is less and less human effort needed to sustain life. This would be a good thing if opportunities to work (or at least to benefit from the work machines do) were properly distributed.\nthe wealthiest people have access to unlimited money and credit with which to buy, out-invest or undercut any competition\nHowever productive the workers are, rent always increases commensurately confiscating much of the wealth created. Despite many rags-to-riches tales of social mobility, most productive people will never control the wealth they produce unless they first own the means of production, and ultimately the land which brings food sovereignty.\nFew solutions then, are recognising the power and role of banks or addressing the (economic) root causes of poverty. We may seek political solutions, but we also need to find ways to withdraw our patronage en masse. \nIn section two we will look in more detail at bank-money and how banks control the main function of money, payments. \n1.3     Resourcing the solidarity economy\nFor many years, impassioned activists have been making reasonable arguments about the need for a Green New Deal, or pointing out how the Military industrial complex does not increase the security of ordinary people.\nBut no argument seems to divert the constant flow of money towards what Buckminster Fuller called life-sustaining projects from war, bureaucracy, decadence, and propping up insolvent banks. Governments who used to provide essential infrastructure now expect private companies to build everything with private capital. Private capital flows on the basis of profitability alone, its dearth of ethics being applauded by neoliberal fundamentalists.\nThe assumption that the market will meet all needs, means the ones who can’t even get to the market are discounted, left to charities and do-gooders. Similarly environmental, spiritual, cultural, and humanitarian projects with no intention to make a profit are regarded as marginal, more so in an economic ‘downturn’. \nThe situation is further hindered by laws which prevent the unemployed from volunteering, and nonprofits from taking unpaid volunteers.\nNot to deny the importance of money, many organisations are failing to tap into a wealth of resources lying idle in their communities. Pensioners, lonely and bored, people on sick pay who can work but maybe not take responsibility, and even unemployed could be engaged discreetly. What is lacking is the organisation to put volunteers in useful work the emotional hooks to motivate them, and the means to reward volunteers, whether it be a sense of ownership or entitlement, or the ability to access goods and services.\nIn short, as the formal economy shrinks, valuable labour and all kinds of resources are left idle as need grows. The solidarity economy can grow by matching the unmet needs and unused resources, which is one of the core messages of timebanking. Insofar as money is NOT used, producers own their produce, and need submit neither accounts nor tax returns, nor repay debt nor comply with all kinds of legislation.\nWe have some examples, some templates and tools, mostly not very modern, of what such an economy can look like. The cooperative movement has been huge. Great solidarity is witnessed in the aftermath of natural disasters. There are ecovillages, social enterprises, charity also has a role to play. But all the pieces are scattered\nTo conclude this section I invite you to consider Chilean economist Manfred Max Neef’s vision of a bottom up financial system:\nThe financial institutions that may be concerned with local financing of Human Scale Development must state goals and forms of operation going far beyond conventional principles. In the first place, these institutions must promote local creativity and support community initiatives that are organized through solidarity, horizontal and equitable relationships. Second, they must encourage the greatest possible circulation of money at the local level. This means attracting locally generated surpluses and making them circulate as many times as possible within the local space, thus increasing the multiplier effect of a given level of deposits and savings. Third, these institutions must adjust themselves so that the savers, or the generators of surpluses, may decide on the use of their resources, thus allowing for a greater transparency in the relationship between saver and investor that may, in turn, promote greater participation in activities devoted to making development alternatives in the local space more viable. Fourth, these financial institutions must be managed in a cooperative way by people in the community itself, which means that the management should also be local in origin. Finally, if the local financial institution is to gain credibility, it must be protected against any potential liquidity crisis.\nWho among us even knows how to build a financial institution? Before that we need to re-learn how to trust and cooperate, how to give and receive, how to put down our own projects to move further, faster with others’. \n\f\n2    Understanding payments infrastructure\n2.1     Ledgers and rails\nThe coins jangling in our pockets and the paper furled in our wallets, feel to their bearers like a commodity which can be exchanged for other commodities, as if they had value-in-themselves. And in a very practical sense, if not in a legal one, we do own they money in our pockets. But most money is not in the form of cash but in the form of bank deposits, which is something else entirely. As with money, we need to know who has the right to create bank deposits, and who gives value to bank deposits, by what law banks are allowed to subtract them from our accounts, and how transaction charges can be so high 6 years since the invention of blockchains. Bank deposits behave much less like a commodity than money - it is created from nothing as a liability, it is always owned by the bank and can only move within a legally defined infrastructure. The balance in my account is merely the promise of the bank to give me cash if it is able, and if it wants to. The 97% of modern money which is bank deposits is privately owned in the sense that it is issued at the discretion of, at a price determined by, and for the profit of, private banking institutions.\nBut banks do not only store money and earn rent on credit issued ex nihilo. Banks also perform the other function of money which is making payments, and earn vast sums from doing so. Moving money is as simple as debiting one account and crediting another. We can see how this works in Western Union where cash is paid in office and paid out of another office in another country moments later. It is clear the actual money wasn’t transferred between franchise outlets, only the promise of it. All banking networks and within banks are working with these promises, of money, of gold, of other promises.\nNote that a ledger entry does not cause real money to change hands. The ledger’s unit of account is a virtual money or a promise to pay ‘real money’. For that reason, in banking, ‘pay’ means the same as ‘promise to pay’ or ‘transfer a promise to pay’.\nA ledger, in the sense that I mean it, is merely a list of transactions between accounts. Because every transaction is a subtraction from one account and an addition to another, the sum of all accounts must necessarily be zero, thus a ledger has a sort of built-in integrity.\nA ledger records payments between accounts by simply adding a line. The money, or the promise can by definition only be in one place at one time. There is no duplication possible. Whether the ledger is on paper, on a single spreadsheet, or in a single table database it is integral in a way that two ledgers might not be.\nBetween accounts in one ledger, payments take place instantaneously and definitively. A ledger is often likened to a railway network in which carriages flow easily between endpoints. But this is only as useful as the ledger is large. Each bank keeps its own ledger but payments between banks and between countries present a technical challenge of ensuring the integrity of the accounts. Payments must be certain to ‘leave’ one ledger and enter another despite typically running on different computers with different software and different owners. And there needs to be an audit trail. There must be no chance of payments derailing and not arriving, or of payments arriving without leaving anywhere!\nStrong technology and legal oversight exists to ensure sure that both organisations’ auditors agree on the accounts and that promises were not lost or duplicated as they streamed from ledger to ledger and from database to database and from network to network, and that everything is reported to the authorities.\nThe obvious solution is ledger of ledgers, which only banks can connect to and in many cases is owed by a cooperative of those banks, such as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, SWIFT.\nNeedless to say, banking rails which are plugged into the global financial network are tightly controlled and expensive.\nThat is why banks regard their rails as private property and charge rent for the use of them.\n2.2    Monopolies and blockchains\n\"Whoever controls the data centre exercises political and economic control over communications. It’s difficult to see how we can counteract these recentralising tendencies in order to build a common core infrastructure... barriers include the age-old problem of scaling distributed forms of organisation beyond the local\"\nIt is important to note that a ledger has to be owned and someone had to be trusted to maintain the ledger with integrity. A ledger owner has the power to move money between accounts, to inspect, edit, delete, deny and crucially, siphon off transaction fees (or any charges).\nMany thinkers believe that certain types of infrastructure should be excluded from the realm of competition because the duplication of those services creates huge complexities and inefficiencies. Those services, they argue, should be run by the state. But this reasoning went to the wall in the ongoing orgy of privatisation started in the 1980s. The notion of rails reminds Englishmen of the British Rail, a natural monopoly owned by the government which was privatised by ruling ideologues in the 1990s. There were price rises, safety concerns, large profits, and even now station staff can often find better prices than the computerised booking system. But I would point out that even in the midst of this farce, the rails were still managed by one company, Railtrack.\nI know of no Western government which owns its payment rails outside the postal service. This critical infrastructure is almost all owned by private corporations. This ‘natural’ cartel would have us believe that the only way to move ‘money’ is to own or rent the rails from payer to payee. Many small, specialist and startup payments companies with no rails of their own pay to piggy-back on the rails of one of these corporations because building another set of rails would be prohibitively expensive.\nThe Islamic system of Hawala takes a different approach. Instead of infrastructure to guarantee the system integrity, hawala relies on trust and the personal reputations of the agents at either end. This has the unfortunate consequence of avoiding any rails, transaction charges and surveillance, which has put this ancient low-tech system on the wrong side of post 9/11 anti-money-laundering laws dictated to the world by the US banking system jealous of our privacy.\n2.3    A note on Bitcoin\nAll I’ve said until now should help to explain the disruptive potential of blockchain technologies. Its success would mean the obviation of whole payments cartel. \nThe Bitcoin infrastructure is not owned, but is a de-facto commons. This raises difficult questions about governance, which became a serious problem when a fork, Bitcoin XT was proposed. Decisions in Bitcoin are taken democratically, not with one person/one vote, but one miner/one vote. The owners of the mining machines are not representative of all Bitcoin’s stakeholders. The major dilemma in the community is now whether to develop the system towards greater adoption by complying with regulation, or to continue in the legal grey areas but upholding libertarian ideals.\nThere is much confusion in the cryptocurrency discourse about the decentralisation of money and payments. All cryptocurrencies are built on a singleton ledger which is distributed across many machines. A single ledger is a point of centralisation, as is a single currency, even if there are many copies of the ledger in a distributed data architecture. Advocates of economic and financial decentralisation are very pleased to have witnessed the arrival of blockchain technologies, but cannot celebrate all the focus on a single currency with a single issuance policy (or algorithm) on a singleton ledger. Many have envisaged a multi-currency marketplace with cryptocurrencies freely competing, thus allowing for a deeper decentralisation, but progress in this direction is as slow as uptake of those alt-currencies, almost none of which have any basis for being valuable, (such as a commodity backing or legal pronouncement) nor could compete with Bitcoin in any meaningful way.\n\n\n\f\n3. Towards a monetary commons\nRachel O'Dwyer attempts to define a monetary commons thus:\n\"what we’re talking about isn’t just the implementation of a complementary currency that is held and produced in common, or the widespread re-appropriation of the production of money, but a monetary design that specifically supports forms of social and material reproduction. For example this includes health, education, and care services and from a monetary perspective, a Universal Basic Income and/or access to inexpensive credit.\"\nThere are several ideas here which would make fascinating exploration but I would like to offer a more distilled definition based on the widely held understanding that 97% of existing ‘money’ is in fact bank deposits. As we have seen, money feels to its user like property and in that sense it can be held and managed collectively. But with a deeper understanding we can see that to really own our money, we must be able to issue it and control the payments infrastructure.\nCreating a global payments infrastructure is however easy with blockchains. But creating an institution which has the right to promise money it doesn’t have, typically requires putting down a deposit of $50m before a single brick has been laid. Small banks may not be commercially viable. Then the right to issue money is highly regulated, and paying to accounts in other banks necessarily involves using other rails. So this approach could produce useful results, if done with the right intentions. The ‘ethical banks’ are small and risk-averse, limited by the amount held on deposit, and they find it hard to lend to the most worthwhile projects.\nThis paper proposes something much more radical.\nAs long as we believe the story of ‘legal tender’ we will be at the mercy of those who write the law. Legal tender, and promises to pay legal tender are highly regulated. Government give themselves the right to define money on behalf of the people, then they spend, tax, monitor, order debts be discharged in, and surveil that money. Furthermore a bank’s promise to pay legal tender can be used completely interchangeably with legal tender itself, even for payment of taxes, even if the bank is insolvent! Although legal tender is supposed to be a way that a government can issue money from nothing, accountable to parliament according to the needs of the economy, it no longer serves the economy but only the banks. Control over the quantity of money has passed to the banks who now issue 97% of it, and not to serve the economy but to maximise rent income in the form of interest.\nIt could be that there is no way to reform this system, to make it serve the real economy, to bring it back under democratic control. It could be that if we want a money system that that serves value creators rather than value extractors, unleashes potential rather than enslaving it, and which expresses the collective intention, we will need to start from scratch.\n3.1    Currency value & taxability\nWhen money is ‘backed’ that means that the issuer guarantees to exchange it for a commodity at a predetermined price. The money is in effect a warehouse receipt for, say 1 twenty-fifth of an ounce of gold. This has the effect of anchoring the value of the currency to the value of the backing commodity, which inspires confidence where it may otherwise be lacking. Most of the current wave of local currencies are backed by legal tender.\nA currency’s backing is very important to establish the legal status and also the value of a currency. If a currency can be priced unequivocally in dollars, transactions will be taxed at the dollar rate. This is entirely appropriate for a business which is doing barter as a way to get better prices of free liquidity but which otherwise measures its profit in dollars.\nIf there is no convertibility to dollars governments step beyond their philosophical remit (this is just my opinion; I’ve never heard a government attempt to justify its actions or its existence philosophically). Rather than tax the money changing hands, guidelines around LETS taxation indicate that professional work itself should be taxed, at the going rate. So I could unblock the sink of an old lady for LETS no problem, but a plumber would have to declare the work done and pay tax on the normal callout charge. It starts to get absurd. What if the plumber invoiced a nominal amount, or charged no LETS at all, or registered an unwritten favour?\nIs it legal to give my labour to a friend instead of selling it for money? Does government claim ownership of everything of value we produce? Does government determine the value everything using its own legal tender as a measure? Is any life or property possible without money being demanded from people under threat of force? This is a legal grey area that needs to be explored.\n3.2    Ledger money\nWe have seen above a kind of virtual money which exists on a ledger as the imbalance between accounts. There is no money, zero, in the ledger, but only account balances going up and down, their total always being zero.\nLedgers in banks and other corporations are used to store promises of real money, because it is easier to track and transport promises than cash. The intention is always to settle the balance at a later date with a single net payment; sometimes settlement is not even necessary if the net balance is close to zero. Sometimes these systems are said to provide liquidity because they allow payments without cash.\nA ledger used in this way, is called a credit clearing system. Before computers, all the cheques paid into the banks in one day would go to the clearing house where they would be added up and cancelled out. Banks would pay each other only the difference. Clearing means much the same even today: the hassle of moving actual money can be reduced insofar as transactions can be cleared beforehand, and this is precisely what ledgers do. And payment need never be made as long as accounts stay within a tolerable trustworthy distance of zero.\nConventional bank deposits are created on a balance sheet, thus as property, but on a ledger the payments between accounts are more like flows, or even relationships.\nLedger money is not minted or printed, it has no physical form and no fixed quantity. Starting from zero, Alice can pay Bob 10 units. Then Alice’s account is -10 and Bob’s +10. The total is zero. Bob can pay Carol, and Carol, Alice. When Alice’s balance is back to zero she can walk away, having paid and been paid without the hassle of shipping units back and forth in armoured vehicles.\nAnother way of looking at it is that spending and earning the internal currency units simultaneously creates and destroys ‘money’ such that, by definition there is always the right amount of it to represent the current credit/debit relationships.\nAlice’s having ‘owed’ the system for some time is not counted a debt and need not produce interest. In order for Bob to receive widgets before he paid widgets, someone else had to pay before they received. This is a reciprocal relationship and totally different from the commodity money paradigm in which the wealthy own all the money (or at least the right to promise what they don’t have) and rent it out to the poor. And let us not forget that what is really valuable here is not the money, but the goods and services flowing in the opposite direction!\nLedger money fulfils two of the three classical functions of money: the medium of exchange and the unit of account; but not the store of value function. Economists such as Silvio Gesell argued strongly that ‘money’ should not be intended as a long term store of value since the primary properties of money are its liquidity and virtuality. The store of value function should be performed by commodities or securitised commodities, and to expect money to perform all three functions is an error of thinking.\n3.3    Mutual credit economics\nUsing a ledger in this way, as a closed system with accounts extending credit to each other, is sometimes called mutual credit. This term focuses not so much on the clearing aspect, but on the fact that credit can be made available to anyone at any time, and the risk entailed by that credit is spread out across the whole system. In the event of an account being abandoned rather than being closed at zero, the whole system deviates from the perfect zero, and all members are affected equally when the total supply and total demand leave equilibrium.\nThis notion of economic equilibrium is a guiding principle of a mutual credit economy, and not of the global economy which is a competition to accumulate the most. Another word for economic equilibrium, is exchange, because parties give and receive in equal measure. When giving exactly equals receiving, the account balance is zero and only then may the account be closed. Since all accounts have agreed to close on zero, after Alice has paid Bob ten units, Alice is looking to earn 10 units and Bob is looking to spend ten units; thus supply equals demand. In a fiat or commodity money system, the governors, if they care, must use voodoo to calculate how much money to put into circulation for optimal trading without inflation, without bubbles, and without unemployment. In a mutual credit system this is a non-question. The political question then becomes, how much can people be trusted to deviate from zero and still return?\nThe further away a balance is from zero, the greater the risk that that account will fail to reciprocate. If no deviation were allowed there would be no liquidity and no trade. If infinite deviation was allowed, some players would only ever give and others only take. We observed earlier that supply always equals demand. Every force has an equal and opposite force. When accounts are hovering around their limits, struggling to reciprocate, that means there is equal and opposite pressure elsewhere in the system.\nA well-managed system will be able to mitigate these pressures by paying attention to those accounts and making it easier for them to trade back in the right direction.\nA poorly managed system may be lucky if negative failures to return to zero cancel out positive failures - defaults can be in either direction.\nOnce the design problem of how credit should be allocated is decided, perhaps by the people whose credit it is, which is everybody, then as much credit can be created as needed.\nAny system can of course have tweaks and redistributive mechanisms, but the fundamental properties are still important. Commodity money must be earned (or borrowed at interest) before it can be spent; the more of it you have, the better it is for you, though that might mean others are deprived. Those who have a scarce commodity (money), get more from renting it out. The day to day governance of such instruments is done through interest rate manipulation and taxing/spending, but the flagrant injustices of this paradigm are never fully mitigated by social security and other forms of redistribution.\nUsually some accounts have difficulty earning as much as they would like to spend and vice versa. Because these problems can affect the whole system, the whole system has an incentive to support those accounts, either by trading with them preferentially, redistributing credit or coming to some other arrangement. This mutual support is visible for what it is, not welfare bleeding out of the pay-packets of the people who actually work, but enabling everyone to both give and receive, which is essential for the health of the whole system.\nIt is well understood how spending locally can create a multiplier effect, and all local currencies seek to strengthen and make visible that virtuous circle. In that sense, a local currency can build solidarity within the local economy insofar as it actually diverts spending towards the local economy, which is a very difficult thing to measure.\nBut there is a deeper solidarity within a mutual credit system than within the multitude of Euro proxies which have sprung up in recent years. The value of the system depends on the engagement of the members and the quality of their experiences, which is the subject of the third paper in this series. The wealth gains that come from good governance, a glut of production and the wellbeing of the precarious members are spread around much more in a mutual credit system than in a commodity money system, where all the wealth gains are sent to the top of the pyramid as rents are adjusted.\nAll of which is why mutual credit is the money of the solidarity economy.\n3.4    Mutual credit in the real world\nAt the post WWII Bretton Woods conference, Keynes proposed that international trade be conducted through a country-to-country mutual credit system called the Bancor. The conference initially agreed the idea was sound and just, but then the USA unilaterally squashed the idea with a dollar/gold standard, then defaulted on their obligations and created the petrodollar system. Today few alternatives are discussed but the idea of going to back to the bancor has been mooted.\nThis is especially significant for an economy experiencing deflation - a scarcity of circulating money. The act of one account extending trust to another account to enable it to participate in a ‘split barter’ exchange can be seen as an act which creates liquidity. While ledgers are used throughout the financial world, there are much fewer examples of ledgers being used without the intention ever to settle, which is to say to settle debts through reciprocal exchange rather than money changing hands. \nThe most prominent is surely the business barter industry which helps businesses move unsold stock and get bums on otherwise empty seats, \nfollowed by the LETS movement which encourages the middle classes to meet each other and save money together. (French SEL, German Tauschkreis)\nfinally timebanking, in which poor and excluded people are given opportunities to support each other and build confidence. \nAt present a great many of these systems are poorly governed from a credit perspective and have a poor understanding of how mutual credit is supposed to work. Regulation within the business barter industry fails to prevent the owners of exchanges running up a deficit, which means buying all the best stuff and flooding the members with credit, and then never earning that credit back. Similar things happen in LETS and timebanks, but usually not for personal gain.\nThis has the effect that credit accumulates in members’ accounts and they want to spend, but the corresponding debit is not looking to earn. Thus the marketplace has more buyers than sellers and very often barter dollars change hands at less than parity with US dollars; inflation in these systems is a sure sign of poor governance. Bartercard national franchises do this routinely, I understand, but since their accounts are private, their innocence or guilt cannot be established.\nWhen the same things happens in LETS and timebanks, it matters much less because members depend less on these systems and are more forgiving. The governing board may decide to issue some credit to express the collective intention of the community, say to organise a festival, and the units may not be collected back in tax or entrance fees. The party account may stay negative forever and the corresponding units may slosh around creating a net positive balance in all the other accounts. Then someone might die with an equivalent positive balance and unwittingly the equilibrium is restored.\nI have heard members of business barter systems report that it didn’t work for them, never quite sure why it was so much easier to earn than spend the barter credit, members of LETS and Time banks almost always have positive experiences, often despite poor fiscal governance! The reason is because a mutual credit accounting system, accompanied by a directory of goods and services, exists to enable exchange and yields positive, productive relationships by the way. In contrast, the legal tender economy forces producers compete globally for every dollar or face poverty and shame languishing on the heap of the unemployed.\nMany members report feeling that this ledger money is easier to earn and less painful to give - it unlocks generosity.\n\n\f\n4    Federating local currencies\nThe credit commons is the notion, perhaps first voiced by Tom Greco, that local ledgers should be connected together using public infrastructure rails, with each currency retaining control of its own issuance and balance of trade, but governed cooperatively. I hope to explore the details below.\nThere have been a great many local exchange platforms created in the last few years but no sharing of code and certainly no interoperability between them. Teams who want to facilitate community exchange have given all their effort to building custom software and not enough to re-usable software and not enough to building community.\nSee the appendix for a condensed list of community exchange platforms none of which are interoperable and many of which have failed to thrive owing to lack of uptake. \nNote that while the credit commons itself is proposed to be a mutual credit system, any type of currency could participate. All that is required of a candidate member is an account for import/export and trust from existing members that the candidate will return to zero.\nThis section discusses some of the design parameters of a mutual credit federation.\n4.1    Legal Structure\nThere are pros and cons to using formal structures. For example managing a bank account in the name of an association is easier and more trusted than someone’s personal account. My vision of the credit commons is an informal association, accountable only to its members, which does not handle money at all. This is how Bitcoin works. There is no association but anyone can install some free software and just plug into the network. Later the Bitcoin Foundation was created to help grow Bitcoin but many users didn’t regard the foundation as legitimate.\nBy contrast the credit commons would embody a similar libertarian ethic, but instead of being an open system without trust, it would consist of private groups who may or may or not trust each other. Thus anyone could open an account in a credit commons, but only trusted people and groups could exchange. In this arrangement I see no benefit to registering the credit commons as an organisation, since no money should change hands and no legal recourse is needed between trusted parties.\n4.2    Governance\nThe most important governance question in a mutual credit system is to manage risk on behalf of all the members by determining the extent to which accounts can deviate from zero. Within a scarcity worldview, it is much more important to manage the negative limit both because members fear losing out and because there is more incentive to take without giving.\nSince the credit is mutually guaranteed by all member groups and by extension, all members of all member groups, it is critical that at least this part of the governing process be participative. The same principle applies in the legal tender economy, but there is no acknowledgement that it is workers who give value to money and risk management is done by banks only to maximise their profits and losses.\nAlso credit must be allocated as far as possible on a case-by-case basis. Banks are increasingly automating loan applications using algorithms, and while this is good for profits it does not serve entrepreneurs. The way to process credit applications more quickly is not through automation, but through the kind of aggregation we see in microcredit, where a loan request must be guaranteed by several people. In the credit commons a whole community would apply for credit from the collective of communities, and that community would guarantee that credit.\nThe governing process has other responsibilities, as in any community money system: managing relations and especially disputes between communities, monitoring communities who may be struggling with their balance of trade; recruiting new members, managing public perception.\nGovernance could be done by volunteers, or compensated volunteers. Any tax and any ‘wages’ could only be denominated in credit for goods and services.\nThere might be a centralised brokering service to stimulate trade, and that brokering might be paid for with taxes or transaction fees. Alternatively brokering could be done by private individuals who could earn commission, in credit.\n4.3    Nesting\nThe credit commons is an open infrastructure for community currency groups to make multilateral exchange agreements. Those groups are private and voluntary associations of individuals who may invite others to join them. Thus newcomers could not automatically join a private group but could form their own group. There could be many networks there which are not connected at all and there could be hierarchies of groups. For example all the time banks in UK could form a group to manage hours liquidity amongst themselves and Timebanks UK could be part of another group of all the national timebanking associations, also using the same unit of account, hours, which is the defining feature of timebanking.\nAt each level of organisation there would need to be a governing process comprising all its members.\nSimilarly the business barter networks could have their own arrangements in the same credit commons without touching timebanking, or as long as exchange rate mechanism is agreed, it could touch timebanking.\nThus payments from user to another might be registered at several levels depending how far in network space, the payment is going. A payment to a timebank in another country would have to obey the balance limits of both groups concerned at each level.\nThe concept of nesting credit clearing systems has also been discussed in the International Journal of Complementary Currency research\n4.4    Exchange rate mechanisms & balance limits\nThe impossible trinity applies equally to credit commons economies as to national economies:\nThe Impossible trinity (also known as the Trilemma) is a trilemma in international economics which states that it is impossible to have all three of the following at the same time:\nA stable foreign exchange rate\nFree capital movement (absence of capital controls)\nAn independent monetary policy. \nSince the credit commons is a tool for distributing political power and issuance of credit to the local level, independent monetary policy is not negotiable. A stable foreign exchange rate is maintained by curbing imports and exports, which is to say, balancing exports and imports. This gives every community an incentive to produce if wants to import and to spend if it wants to export. The designers of the Euro would have done well to apply such an ethic. Furthermore, speculation and price manipulation of currencies is contained according to the proportion of each community’s credit which is allowed to circulate outside its own accounts.\nThe post gold-standard FOREX system of currency exchange is a free market; this design has a self correcting mechanism which helps to keep prices stable. As the price of a currency deviates from its actual purchasing power, the price of goods and services in that country becomes distorted in a way that attracts trade in the opposite direction. For example, if a currency is undervalued, that country’s exports become cheaper, and demand for them increases, which drives up the currency price. This tendency towards stability is desirable in the credit commons.\nBut within that framework, it is possible for a community with a sovereign monetary policy, to stabilise its own prices using credit/debit allocated for that purpose. This is perfectly sound practice as long as the limits are respected. All communities are allowed to issue credit/debit and can use it equally for liquidity with other communities or for stabilising their own currency. In the case of fraud, damage would be limited only according to how much trust had been allocated to the rogue community, and would not be contagious.\nIn small scale systems the precise exchange rate matters much less. The largest community currency system has been running 15 years using exchange rates fixed a long time ago, and had no issues.\nThe question remains then, as explained above, how balance limits are decided between member exchanges. Greater balance limits mean greater risk, which is to say greater impact in case of failure to return to zero. Each group should decide its own process/formula through a political process. Limits should be imposed by a custom script or plugin in the accounting software and not set in stone. There are plenty of examples from which to take inspiration.\nIn the banking system it is normal to grant individuals overdrafts up to two months of salary without asking too many questions. Larger loans, for commerce and business startups, need to be scrutinised by the bank which has a mandate to be risk averse.\nEvery business barter network has its own formula or process for allocating credit, which usually takes into account the desirability of the applicants produce and their trading volume.\nWithin LETS, there are many theories about how balance limits should be determined. Typically a minimum limit is given to new members, which increases proportionately with volume of trade. \nBOX: In Western Austria 'talents' were flowing from a rural Tauschkreis to a nearby urban one and both systems on were stuck on their respective limits and in danger of freezing. They put their heads together and organised a rural festival and bussed in the city folk to spend their talents back and restore the balance.\n\n4.5    Experiences of previous federations\nThe credit commons may be a new formulation, but the federation of local currencies has been attempted many times since the emergence of LETS in the 1980s.\n4.5.1    Business barter\nThe business barter sector has many federations already because this is the business model of the software providers.\nTypically one software is sold to as many exchanges as possible and the vendor takes a dollar commission from each inter-exchange transactions, which seems inappropriate because no dollars change hands and also disincentivises exchange, more so if the fee is high.\nThis model of federation serves the software providers more than the traders because it carves up the marketplace, keeping traders separate according to their exchange’s software choice. In this way of thinking, members are property to be owned, before they are customers to be served!\nThis way also causes problems because the software providers assume that each exchanges barter dollars are worth the same without checking the integrity of the exchanges, which all to often are suffering from a profligate house account.\nThe International Reciprocal Trade Organisation sought to improve the situation by introducing another currency governed by itself, called Universal Currency. The system is its own platform and thus members have the experience of being in two exchanges and using two currencies. In 2014 the system ran into liquidity problems and fraud allegations followed. The system has now been rebooted in partnership with Bartercard, but it is not clear that the governance problems were addressed.\n4.5.2    LETS\nIn the 1990s there were several attempts to make accounting software for LETS using databases on local machines. The most valiant attempt at intertrading using Access was in Scotland where everyone was using a well developed MS Access application called SAM. The LETS of LETS was held in a separate instance of SAM and transactions were communicated by email.\nAround 2003 CES arrived, a web service allowing LETS to have their own web site in which members managed their own accounts rather than processing cheques communicating by post. CES grew quickly when it offered an intertrading mechanism between exchanges. A fixed exchange rate was calculated according to the national currency and the time-value of each exchanges unit, and this persists to this day.\nThe author of this document and CTO of Community Forge attempted to improve the CES system with an open API and in 2012 but the task was too onerous.\nSeveral LETS around Zurich are networked together with a semi automatic system which requires they all use the same platform.\n4.5.3    Timebanking\nTimebanking software has always been much more centralised than LETS being produced by the national associations rather than the communities themselves. Thus all the timebanking platforms, sharing a unit of account have enjoyed a high degree of interoperability.\nThe initial USA and UK systems were poorly built and managed and eventually both gave way to a free, well run, but closed source platform which now hosts several hundred timebanks. This means those timebanks are interoperable in theory but so far no policy exists to manage trading limits and no API to include software hosted elsewhere.\n\n\n\f\n5    Natural analogies\n5.1    A biomimicry perspective\nThis section was co-authored with Jamie Brown-Hansen.\nThe field of biomimicry is, among other things, a way of doing biology that looks for unifying patterns in the design of natural systems. There is enormous diversity in the natural world, yet biologists are able to identify certain design strategies that are common across multiple species and even kingdoms of species. Some of the deepest design patterns, in fact, can be recognised in almost all biological systems at every scale, from bacteria to multicellular organisms to entire ecosystems. These unifying patterns are referred to within the biomimicry community as Life’s Principles. They represent a design framework that has delivered thriving, regenerative systems in the natural world for 3.8 billion years, a proven recipe for long-term success within the operating conditions of this planet that we can apply where relevant in the effort to achieve sustainable human systems, including our systems of exchange.\nThe proposal of the credit commons is consistent with many of nature’s core unifying design patterns: it is bottom-up, locally attuned and adapted, diverse, decentralised, iterative, modular, and premised on quantitative stability over time. The interconnection of community-based mutual credit systems is also endorsed by the Bio-credits Working Group of the Biomimicry Global Network in answer to the question, “How would nature design a financial system?” The remainder of this section draws out some specific characteristics of the credit commons proposal that are consistent with natural system design.\n5.1.1 Locally attuned and adapted\nIn the natural world, chances of survival improve when organisms are well adapted and responsive to local conditions around them. Similarly, after decades of policy experimentation and experience, sustainable development strategists have learned that the most appropriate prescriptions for human development in any given region are attuned and adapted to local context. In the conventional bank credit system innovations in system design are templated first at the global level and make their way down to national level implementation thereafter, often without further adaptation to the contexts of individual communities.\nSome measures have shown strong correlations with good econometric outcomes across the board, such as investments in health, education and women. However, some experiences of standardised policy prescriptions applied to countries irrespective of local context have also been catastrophic. For example after the 2008 financial crisis, a committee in Basel required that banks to increase their capital requirements, which lead to a wave of debt-related suicides amongst farmers in India.\nThe credit commons starts with local innovation by communities themselves, attuned and adapted to their particular context and needs.\n5.1.2 Bottom-up development combining modular and nested components\nLiving systems assemble components one unit at a time, with development starting at the smallest scale. Simple solutions to a basic problem are nested within larger systems to form more complex entities. Starting with simple building blocks moving to more complex allows all the parts of the new system to grow and develop in response to local contexts, from the bottom up. This recalls the biological metaphor of cohabiting cells working together to form a multicellular organism. A cell is a (comparatively) simple entity and a life form in its own right. Biology gives us many examples of cells working together and specialising to make an organism with a higher degree of organisation.\nThe credit commons proposes that the economy be re-imagined from the bottom up in a self-organised manner analogous to the design process of the natural world. The power of the state to force citizens to accept its promises as money is anathema to notions of freedom of persons, and of markets. Considering the value of legal tender monies rests entirely on the productivity of the citizens, they are the natural candidates to issue promises for produce, if money be such. Systems in which a currency is imposed from the above lead to disparities in the availability of the currency, as we see in the Eurozone between Germany and Greece, for example. The biomimetic principle of designing from the bottom up would suggest every person, or more likely every economy, have its own currency for internal trade, and that complexity and scale be layered on top of that stable system.\n5.1.3    Embody resilience through systemic diversity and decentralisation \nClose to the principle of building from the bottom up is the principle of decentralisation. Many centres increases the resilience of the whole system, because it reduces dependences and single points of failure. Natural systems maintain function following disturbance by incorporating a variety of duplicate forms, processes, or systems that are not located exclusively together. \nThe Biomimicry Resource Handbook explains: “Resilience is the capacity of a system to maintain function following a disturbance. In short, it is the ability to recover after adversity. The capacity for resiliency, from bodily organs to ecosystems, often depends on the interconnectedness and functional diversity of multiple systems. When one system fails or does poorly, others can step in to compensate, either briefly or long term. As the nature of the disturbance is unpredictable, variation in strategies allows for some to endure while others may be lost. Redundancy permits the remaining to continue despite losing some, and decentralisation ensures that independent of where the disturbance falls, not all components will be subject to its impacts.”\nThe credit commons can be understood as a permaculture landscape of diverse local models interacting with each other, analogous to a natural ecosystem. A variety of locally attuned credit modules interacting in dynamic non-equilibrium is a more resilient structure than the metaphorical monoculture of today’s prevailing monetary system, according to former central banker, Bernard Lietaer.\n5.1.4    Protective membranes regulating in/out\nIn modern economies the balance of trade figure reveals how much value a country is gaining or losing. It is obtained by measuring the flow of the national currency across borders. It is very hard to obtain this figure for local or regional economies which use the same currency as their neighbours. With much more localised currencies, this figure can tell us a lot about microeconomic health and activity. Each member of a mutual credit network has a maximum extent to which its balance can deviate from zero. These limits function like a membrane of a cell, revealing the value going in and out to the wider system. In economic terms a balance-of-trade indicator is built in to each economy and the health and needs of each economy becomes visible. Limits can be set by local economy AND by the higher order system and the lowest limits respected. This affords local economies a level of protection against strong inflows or outflows of credit which would cause inflation/deflation and distort the value of their currency.\nAs the localities join together to form bioregions, and bioregions to form countries, transactions which have to pass between more balance limits, and more cultural barriers, become more cumbersome and probably more expensive. In this way the credit commons architecture favours localised exchange.\n5.1.5    Fractal design\nAs we have shown, clearing systems can be nested, with one clearing system having an account in a meta system. Smaller local modules are nested within larger regional modules, with the pattern repeated up to the global scale. This is consistent with the pattern of system design in the natural world from microorganism to biosphere. Moreover, not only are facilities in the credit commons modular and nested, they are also iterative. In other words, the same principles of organisation and engagement can be applied at each system level. This is analogous to patterns of fractal design in the nature world. \nFor example, in order for a mutual credit facility to function, all participants must agree to the principle of balanced mutual exchange. In other words, they agree to give and receive equally over the course of their membership in the credit community. Concretely, this can mean, for example, that participants must start with a balance of zero, and end with a balance of zero. This principle applies not just to individual participants in a local credit community, but also to local communities participating in a regional credit facility, and so on up to the global level. In the case of a regional facility, each local community agrees to balance its imports and exports in order to participate; the same principle applied at the next level.\n\nWe would suggest around 4 levels of nesting ranging from local systems to bioregional systems, to national or linguistic regions, to a world clearing system. This allows the same mechanism to serve at all scales of the economy and probably provides a bias towards more local trade, since currencies are more valuable nearer to where they can be spent. \n5.2    Money as flows in a field\nIt is tempting when exploring the True nature of money, as theologians study the bread in the Eucharist, to study the tokens and the exchanges. One popular approach is to posit a substance called 'value' which resides in the tokens, either intrinsically because the tokens are made of some valuable stuff (use value), or by government decree (exchange value). This is reminiscent of the theory of transubstantiation in which the bread somehow 'changes' into into the body of Christ.\nBut this whole approach assumes that money is some kind of stuff which moves from hand to hand. Even fiat money is a commodity insofar as it is valued for itself more than for what it can buy.\nWhen we look at the different ways of issuing money, we see clearly that 97% of modern money is NOT a commodity. It comes from nothing and exists only on bank balance sheets. This is accounting money, the kind used in mutual credit systems. And it has some other interesting properties:\nFor every unit of money created as a liability, there is a corresponding asset created with equal and opposite value\nThe money flows into circulation and at the appointed time some money - not necessarily the same money is pulled out of circulation and cancelled out against the asset, leaving nothing.\nWhen we look at cash we might imagine each piece moves around the economy independently of other money, like a ball bouncing randomly around a pinball machine. But with accounting money you can't mark the bills and track one piece of money just like you can't pinpoint an electron. A better analogy is a field.\nIt turns out that money is very like energy. By studying the substance we miss the wood for the trees. The paradox of money-as-a-commodity and money-as-a-promise is resolved once money is regarded as a circuit or as a wave acting in a field. It is created when no-value splits into assets and liabilities, just like when a neutral photon breaks into a positron and an electron which go spinning off in different directions and times. Money can be seen like electrons leaping from atom to atom, but look at the whole picture and money flows like a wave in a field, pushing waves before it and pulling waves behind it. What matters is not the atoms or the leaping, but the integrity and balance of the circuit. \nAt least, that's when it works.\nWhen we treat money as a commodity, the flows get out of sync. When we hoard money and relend the same money twice we prevent it from returning to source. When we just read the peaks and not the troughs, we miss the coming tsunami.\nWhen, for cultural reasons, borrowers take all the responsibility and risk, while lenders charge rent on their absent 'property' the two parties will never dance well together, leading to gluts and dearths and arhythmia.\nCredit money, or accounting money is very much like electricity, and the conceptual leap if we want master it is the same leap as from Newtonian mechanics to Quantum mechanics.\n\n\n\f\nConclusion\nThere are no reliable statistics, but since the financial system transitioned into the realm of fiction in 2008, the present author has witnessed a noticeable growth in complementary currency activities. The LETS have been declining since at least the turn of the century. Time banking has benefitted from institutional support and more favourable legal rulings, and there are several projects which fit neither family. I judge that the success rate of currency projects remains very low. This is because most complementary currencies are started by an isolated enthusiast, but they can only succeed when many people actively participate. Awareness that money itself may not be a neutral commodity is certainly growing, but that understanding is a long way from making a conscious decision to invest effort in the local economy, and to do so outside of legal tender money.\nIt will be argued therefore, that the very notion of a local economy is so eroded in a global society, and money itself so aspatial, and local money systems so lacklustre that there is nothing to federate.\nBut it can also be argued that a credit commons would strengthen all the local systems, giving them new uses and wider relevance. Local currencies would undoubtedly be more useful if they could be spent in other localities. In addition, the process of making local systems interoperable will increase awareness about how money systems could be run, and what is possible once we learn to cooperate.\nFinally, human architectures of exchange may be better positioned to serve as an organ of planetary ecology, fostering global conditions conducive to biological life, if their patterns of development are consistent with the bottom-up pattern of systems innovation in the natural world. The consistency of design principles can allow human and natural systems to flow more seamlessly together so that “the city can no longer be distinguished from the forest” from a systems design perspective. \nEnough open source software already exists (some created by the author of this document) for local communities to design and own local exchanges. What is needed, I surmise, is \na blockchain protocol, which allows people to organise their promises in the ways described above, and some requirements and explorations will be in the next paper;\nand crucially, to raise awareness of actionable solutions to the monetary paradox and how to implement them for growing numbers of local solidarity groups.\n\n\f\n"

        "text": "As neoclassical economics is pushed towards its logical conclusion, the global economy is entering a phase of massive deleverage and deflation, which means literally not enough money to pay off debts, to invest, to employ.\nWith a better understanding of money itself we can show how the economy went off the rails by confusing a balance sheet entry with value-in-itself. We might also despair at how entrenched this worldview is amongst the elites who decide these things often it seems, in their interests rather than the majority.\nMany things are happening and many alternatives are being proposed and tried. Bitcoin’s release shortly after the financial crisis in 2008 created a vibrant new discourse around disintermediating banks, open payment protocols, and the nature of money itself. Bitcoin has many problems and isn’t really a solution, but our collective learning from it has been huge. This paper proposes a new bottom up monetary infrastructure, the Credit Commons, which already exists in fragments, and better reflects and supports the values and structures of the ‘solidarity economy’\nThe suggestion is not principally that ‘we’ can ‘change’ the money system and hence the economy, although there is some truth to that. But more importantly to point out that such a thing as a ‘solidarity economy’ cannot be built on the current globalised debt-money system; and the kind of money needed for a more beautiful world can be assembled without permission of states, without legal force, and without high running costs.\nThe Credit Commons allows for a multitude of alternative or experimental models to coexist. It puts the credit issuing power in the hands of value creators. There are many existing micro-economies which could easily plug in using an open protocol and open source tools.\nIn economics as in sex, there is nothing new under the sun. The credit commons draws on many intellectual precedents (though this is not a history paper) to revive ideas and principles neglected the main stream.  This paper touches on speculation-proof currency, payment without money, money as a relationship rather than a commodity, ecological design, and aspires to a financial system founded on radical principles like voluntary participation and reciprocal trust.\nThis is the first of 3 proposed papers. The second will explore technical implementations, and the third, a socio-technical approach.\nGlossary\nBitcoin. The first blockchain application and decentralised digital currency. Many libertarians hoped the new technology would disintermediate the banking system and force a correction of many flaws in the money system.\nBlockchain. A blockchain is a database stored across many servers, which maintains data integrity of the data. Open blockchains have clever ways to do this without having to trust any given node, but there are also permissioned blockchains which trust all nominated nodes. \nClearing. The process of cancelling out debts owed between multiple parties. Clearing can be continuous, or it can be a precursor to ‘settlement’ which means paying the outstanding debts with money or something of value.\nCommunity. The members of an exchange.\nCryptocurrency: Any currency which uses a blockchain for its ledger.\nExchange. A group of people who exchange and keep accounts with a ledger. \nLETS. Local exchange trading system. A model for community exchange formulated by Michael Linton, which spread mostly through the middle classes in developed countries the late 1980s and 1990s. Characterised by the use of a ledger plus a directory of members’ offers and needs.\nLedger. A definitive list of payments between accounts, starting with all accounts on zero.\nLocal currency. A specific design of local currency in which attractive pieces of paper with a legal tender face value are sold for that legal tender, which is held in reserve.\nMutual Credit. Closed circle accounting in which the sum of all account balances is necessarily zero. It implies a money system is like a cell with a border and an inner life. This contrasts with more open systems of money which allow the unit of account itself to be hoarded out of circulation and make scarce.\nPayment. Normally this means settling a debt by giving something of value but the meaning becomes blurred when the value of money of questioned or when [banks’] promises to pay money are regarded as good as money itself. So payment can simply mean registering a transaction in a ledger.\nQuantitive Easing (QE) a type of monetary policy used by central banks to stimulate the economy when standard monetary policy has become ineffective. A central bank implements quantitative easing by buying financial assets from commercial banks and other financial institutions, thus raising the prices of those financial assets and lowering their yield, while simultaneously increasing the money supply.\nRails. A ledger seen as a payment router. Ledgers can be networked together for greater coverage.\nRent. Money taken not from productive work but from property owned and lent to someone who needs it.\nSolidarity economy. A general term used to describe the growing numbers of businesses and nonprofits who create economic value but use other metrics of success than monetary profit, and other models of ownership than private property. The word ‘solidarity’ stands in contrast with the competitive ethic which some perceive to be implicit in ‘capitalism’.\nTime bank. A local exchange system which uses hours as the unit of account. Formulated by Edgar Cahn, many governments support timebanking as a ‘social inclusion’ mechanism, and there are national associations in USA, UK, Israel, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere. Many community groups call themselves time banks but have no ties with national organisations.\n\n\n\n1.     Economic & social context\n1.1    Financial crisis without end\nGlobal credit expansion of the magnitude which commenced under Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher and which continues to this day is premised on indefinite economic growth, which is defined as an increase in Gross Domestic Product, or the amount of money changing hands. This a convenient measure for the government because it directly correlates with taxation, but it also in practice corresponds to the rate of resource extraction and CO2 emissions. If and when economic growth does not keep pace with interest repayment demands, the issuance of new debt lags behind debt repayments and the volume of money decreases, stalling the economy. Since 2008 bank lending to productive enterprise has slowed as banks use increasingly cheap money not to re-lend as the government begs them, but to shore up the titanic holes in their balance sheets, which, if officially acknowledged would mean the whole banking sector was insolvent. The real economy is being sacrificed to cover previous reckless profiteering of the financial sector.\nGovernments have only two possible and opposing responses. By turns they are doing both: cutting social spending in order to pay off debts, and increasing debt by injecting new money into bank balance sheets in the hope that banks will lend money into circulation. Interest rates have been lowered to near zero to enable or encourage ever greater borrowing. Overall public debts are still increasing which makes nonsense out of the austerity narrative. Only when we understand that money can be something other than commercial credit can we see ways out of the dilemma, the most obvious of which is to contain bank lending and have government issue ‘sovereign’ money instead which is how most people still think money is issued.\nPerhaps because of the large number of big bank shareholders in and around government, or perhaps because the economics profession has mostly abandoned all approaches except ‘neo-classical’ economics, issuing sovereign money is unthinkable. Many other sensible and obvious economic policies also receive no serious consideration, such as clamping down on use of tax havens, reducing military spending or taxing imports, issuing sovereign money, bailing out the people, inflating away the debt, nationalising too-big-to-fail institutions to name but a few. \nQE may have raised prices of stocks & commodities, and food, but this was offset by very low interest rates and it looks like massive global deleveraging is taking place. Oil, steel and other commodity prices have fallen dramatically in 2015, and with the revaluation of the Yuan in the summer, it became evident that not even Chinese growth could not offset the global slowdown. All developed economies have followed Japan into the deflationary trap; the only way out that we know is from out 1930s experience, when the threat and reality of WWII lead to massive borrowing and full employment, otherwise permanent recession.\nDeflation means that more money is being paid back to banks than is being borrowed from banks. When this ‘debt’ money is repaid, it cancels out on the bank’s balance sheet and no longer exists. The amount of money (circulating) in the world is going down, which means less employment, less money in people’s pockets, less demand for goods and services, and lower prices.\n\nAs interest rates start to dip below zero, there will be a need to prevent people hoarding cash, so banks are waging a propaganda #waroncash in favour of high tech all-digital total-surveillance payments. This would at least have the effect of damping the social unrest which ensues from injustice at such scale. \nModern economies are very much controlled from above, traditionally by government policy but increasingly by 'markets', a euphemism for the combined interests of the largest corporations, many of them financial. There are many ways to intervene in markets, with purchasing policies, regulation & policing, price manipulation, capital controls, and of course the full gamut of mafia tactics and dirty tricks. But perhaps the single most influential way of controlling a whole economy is by throttling its access to credit, a power which now lies exclusively with the banking sector, since quantitative easing has less and less effect.\nIt is no wonder that ordinary people surveying the global economy in hope of a better life for their children can see all the abundance and all the poverty, all the marginalised ideas and all the intransigence and ideology, turn on the TV just for distraction. \nBut before moving on, I want to offer a follow-the-money analysis, an approach which rarely fails to yield insights. This notion of credit control being a single choke-point on the economy, and the fact of this power lying in the hands of entities which debt makes psychopathic and insatiable, seems to be lost on most theorists and commentators; but consider the power of the financial sector:\nIt has enormous holdings and influence all sectors of the economy such as media (propaganda), technology, security, food, health, international relations.\nIt can lend unlimited money, channel it towards certain sectors or companies, set interest rates.\nIt is guaranteed solvency by the taxpayer and immunity to criminal law justified by the too-big-to-fail dogma which says that the success of these banks is less damaging than their failure.\nIt has unlimited budget for lobbying, access to revolving doors and a great many of its shareholders in government posts.\nBy financing the economics profession it has made alternatives to neoclassical economics unthinkable despite repeated crises.\nWith all its data and data-mining capacity, it know us intimately.\nWhile the White House, the deep state, Israel, the Military Industrial Complex and other institutions surely bear responsibility for many of our problems, the greatest single concentration of power must surely be placed in the global banking cartel and its abuse of the money power.\n1.2    Popular responses to the economic malaise\nFrom the 19th Century we still have cooperatives and mutual benefit societies, some of which are thriving. The expression ‘solidarity economy’ emerged from South America and has spread to Europe, and it describes that subset of institutions which value things other than profit. In Spain the integral cooperatives are growing. Also Europe has an degrowth movement with an annual conference. In USA the Italian slow food initiative has been augmented with a slow money initiative. In Austria there is the Economy for the Common Good movement in which businesses audit themselves using a tool similar to triple bottom line accounting.\nFortunately the Great Recession seems to have fueled a range of other discourses which are rarely presented in the mainstream media. \nThere has been a renewed interest in simpler more transparent, more direct financial services. The Move Your Money campaign saw an encouraging movement out of banks and into credit unions but seemingly not enough to have systemic impact. Many social startups and government sponsored experiments are vying to revolutionise finance, investment, and payments with new models such as crowdfunding things banks won’t fund, and peer-to-peer lending which cuts out the bank as an intermediary.\nSuch new financial services could point the way towards a new economy with less speculation and rent-collecting intermediaries, but they do nothing for the present crisis in which money issued as interest bearing debt is draining out of circulation as new loans are less than repayments.\nBitcoin seemed to offer a democratisation of money with a ledger which could not be hacked, new coins being issued to those who invested in securing the network, the possibility of privacy in transactions, and low transaction charges. But the many benefits have not offset other concerns: price instability, the punitive legal judgements, fear-mongering in the financial press, and latterly serious governance issues. Having been designed as a sort of digital gold, Bitcoin suffers from many of the same flaws as gold-money. Any money-as-commodity is vulnerable to hoarding, speculation and throttling by the wealthiest players in the market.\nRachel O’Dwyer puts it more forcefully\n\"It would seem that Bitcoin, far from representing a monetary commons, is instead an ideal financial asset for rent-seeking capitalism. Because of its design there is also no possibility for cheap credit in the Bitcoin system and if the unit matures, a banking system will be necessary to provide credit based on deposits.\"\nBitcoin’s market capitalisation represents nearly $5bn (November 2015) of a new highly liquid commodity. This is a drop in the ocean of quantitative easing, and its lack of circulation means Bitcoin as money is not really mitigating the crisis.\n\nTransition towns and ecovillages across Europe are increasingly aware of the importance of economic development to their wider goals. This movement wide awakening only translates into a small number of dedicated individuals, and the legal, & software tools they need barely yet exist.\nMany local organisations, especially in France, have created their own local currencies. Most of these are 'backed' by legal tender, which means they may serve to nudge shoppers into local procurement, but they neither increase liquidity nor transfer legitimacy from criminal institutions to trusted sources of credit/money.\nIf all this gives grounds for hope I would like to temper it by observing two things which have held true since the roman empire:\ntechnological unemployment means that there is less and less human effort needed to sustain life. This would be a good thing if opportunities to work (or at least to benefit from the work machines do) were properly distributed.\nthe wealthiest people have access to unlimited money and credit with which to buy, out-invest or undercut any competition\nHowever productive the workers are, rent always increases commensurately confiscating much of the wealth created. Despite many rags-to-riches tales of social mobility, most productive people will never control the wealth they produce unless they first own the means of production, and ultimately the land which brings food sovereignty.\nFew solutions then, are recognising the power and role of banks or addressing the (economic) root causes of poverty. We may seek political solutions, but we also need to find ways to withdraw our patronage en masse. \nIn section two we will look in more detail at bank-money and how banks control the main function of money, payments. \n1.3     Resourcing the solidarity economy\nFor many years, impassioned activists have been making reasonable arguments about the need for a Green New Deal, or pointing out how the Military industrial complex does not increase the security of ordinary people.\nBut no argument seems to divert the constant flow of money towards what Buckminster Fuller called life-sustaining projects from war, bureaucracy, decadence, and propping up insolvent banks. Governments who used to provide essential infrastructure now expect private companies to build everything with private capital. Private capital flows on the basis of profitability alone, its dearth of ethics being applauded by neoliberal fundamentalists.\nThe assumption that the market will meet all needs, means the ones who can’t even get to the market are discounted, left to charities and do-gooders. Similarly environmental, spiritual, cultural, and humanitarian projects with no intention to make a profit are regarded as marginal, more so in an economic ‘downturn’. \nThe situation is further hindered by laws which prevent the unemployed from volunteering, and nonprofits from taking unpaid volunteers.\nNot to deny the importance of money, many organisations are failing to tap into a wealth of resources lying idle in their communities. Pensioners, lonely and bored, people on sick pay who can work but maybe not take responsibility, and even unemployed could be engaged discreetly. What is lacking is the organisation to put volunteers in useful work the emotional hooks to motivate them, and the means to reward volunteers, whether it be a sense of ownership or entitlement, or the ability to access goods and services.\nIn short, as the formal economy shrinks, valuable labour and all kinds of resources are left idle as need grows. The solidarity economy can grow by matching the unmet needs and unused resources, which is one of the core messages of timebanking. Insofar as money is NOT used, producers own their produce, and need submit neither accounts nor tax returns, nor repay debt nor comply with all kinds of legislation.\nWe have some examples, some templates and tools, mostly not very modern, of what such an economy can look like. The cooperative movement has been huge. Great solidarity is witnessed in the aftermath of natural disasters. There are ecovillages, social enterprises, charity also has a role to play. But all the pieces are scattered\nTo conclude this section I invite you to consider Chilean economist Manfred Max Neef’s vision of a bottom up financial system:\nThe financial institutions that may be concerned with local financing of Human Scale Development must state goals and forms of operation going far beyond conventional principles. In the first place, these institutions must promote local creativity and support community initiatives that are organized through solidarity, horizontal and equitable relationships. Second, they must encourage the greatest possible circulation of money at the local level. This means attracting locally generated surpluses and making them circulate as many times as possible within the local space, thus increasing the multiplier effect of a given level of deposits and savings. Third, these institutions must adjust themselves so that the savers, or the generators of surpluses, may decide on the use of their resources, thus allowing for a greater transparency in the relationship between saver and investor that may, in turn, promote greater participation in activities devoted to making development alternatives in the local space more viable. Fourth, these financial institutions must be managed in a cooperative way by people in the community itself, which means that the management should also be local in origin. Finally, if the local financial institution is to gain credibility, it must be protected against any potential liquidity crisis.\nWho among us even knows how to build a financial institution? Before that we need to re-learn how to trust and cooperate, how to give and receive, how to put down our own projects to move further, faster with others’. \n\f\n2    Understanding payments infrastructure\n2.1     Ledgers and rails\nThe coins jangling in our pockets and the paper furled in our wallets, feel to their bearers like a commodity which can be exchanged for other commodities, as if they had value-in-themselves. And in a very practical sense, if not in a legal one, we do own they money in our pockets. But most money is not in the form of cash but in the form of bank deposits, which is something else entirely. As with money, we need to know who has the right to create bank deposits, and who gives value to bank deposits, by what law banks are allowed to subtract them from our accounts, and how transaction charges can be so high 6 years since the invention of blockchains. Bank deposits behave much less like a commodity than money - it is created from nothing as a liability, it is always owned by the bank and can only move within a legally defined infrastructure. The balance in my account is merely the promise of the bank to give me cash if it is able, and if it wants to. The 97% of modern money which is bank deposits is privately owned in the sense that it is issued at the discretion of, at a price determined by, and for the profit of, private banking institutions.\nBut banks do not only store money and earn rent on credit issued ex nihilo. Banks also perform the other function of money which is making payments, and earn vast sums from doing so. Moving money is as simple as debiting one account and crediting another. We can see how this works in Western Union where cash is paid in office and paid out of another office in another country moments later. It is clear the actual money wasn’t transferred between franchise outlets, only the promise of it. All banking networks and within banks are working with these promises, of money, of gold, of other promises.\nNote that a ledger entry does not cause real money to change hands. The ledger’s unit of account is a virtual money or a promise to pay ‘real money’. For that reason, in banking, ‘pay’ means the same as ‘promise to pay’ or ‘transfer a promise to pay’.\nA ledger, in the sense that I mean it, is merely a list of transactions between accounts. Because every transaction is a subtraction from one account and an addition to another, the sum of all accounts must necessarily be zero, thus a ledger has a sort of built-in integrity.\nA ledger records payments between accounts by simply adding a line. The money, or the promise can by definition only be in one place at one time. There is no duplication possible. Whether the ledger is on paper, on a single spreadsheet, or in a single table database it is integral in a way that two ledgers might not be.\nBetween accounts in one ledger, payments take place instantaneously and definitively. A ledger is often likened to a railway network in which carriages flow easily between endpoints. But this is only as useful as the ledger is large. Each bank keeps its own ledger but payments between banks and between countries present a technical challenge of ensuring the integrity of the accounts. Payments must be certain to ‘leave’ one ledger and enter another despite typically running on different computers with different software and different owners. And there needs to be an audit trail. There must be no chance of payments derailing and not arriving, or of payments arriving without leaving anywhere!\nStrong technology and legal oversight exists to ensure sure that both organisations’ auditors agree on the accounts and that promises were not lost or duplicated as they streamed from ledger to ledger and from database to database and from network to network, and that everything is reported to the authorities.\nThe obvious solution is ledger of ledgers, which only banks can connect to and in many cases is owed by a cooperative of those banks, such as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, SWIFT.\nNeedless to say, banking rails which are plugged into the global financial network are tightly controlled and expensive.\nThat is why banks regard their rails as private property and charge rent for the use of them.\n2.2    Monopolies and blockchains\n\"Whoever controls the data centre exercises political and economic control over communications. It’s difficult to see how we can counteract these recentralising tendencies in order to build a common core infrastructure... barriers include the age-old problem of scaling distributed forms of organisation beyond the local\"\nIt is important to note that a ledger has to be owned and someone had to be trusted to maintain the ledger with integrity. A ledger owner has the power to move money between accounts, to inspect, edit, delete, deny and crucially, siphon off transaction fees (or any charges).\nMany thinkers believe that certain types of infrastructure should be excluded from the realm of competition because the duplication of those services creates huge complexities and inefficiencies. Those services, they argue, should be run by the state. But this reasoning went to the wall in the ongoing orgy of privatisation started in the 1980s. The notion of rails reminds Englishmen of the British Rail, a natural monopoly owned by the government which was privatised by ruling ideologues in the 1990s. There were price rises, safety concerns, large profits, and even now station staff can often find better prices than the computerised booking system. But I would point out that even in the midst of this farce, the rails were still managed by one company, Railtrack.\nI know of no Western government which owns its payment rails outside the postal service. This critical infrastructure is almost all owned by private corporations. This ‘natural’ cartel would have us believe that the only way to move ‘money’ is to own or rent the rails from payer to payee. Many small, specialist and startup payments companies with no rails of their own pay to piggy-back on the rails of one of these corporations because building another set of rails would be prohibitively expensive.\nThe Islamic system of Hawala takes a different approach. Instead of infrastructure to guarantee the system integrity, hawala relies on trust and the personal reputations of the agents at either end. This has the unfortunate consequence of avoiding any rails, transaction charges and surveillance, which has put this ancient low-tech system on the wrong side of post 9/11 anti-money-laundering laws dictated to the world by the US banking system jealous of our privacy.\n2.3    A note on Bitcoin\nAll I’ve said until now should help to explain the disruptive potential of blockchain technologies. Its success would mean the obviation of whole payments cartel. \nThe Bitcoin infrastructure is not owned, but is a de-facto commons. This raises difficult questions about governance, which became a serious problem when a fork, Bitcoin XT was proposed. Decisions in Bitcoin are taken democratically, not with one person/one vote, but one miner/one vote. The owners of the mining machines are not representative of all Bitcoin’s stakeholders. The major dilemma in the community is now whether to develop the system towards greater adoption by complying with regulation, or to continue in the legal grey areas but upholding libertarian ideals.\nThere is much confusion in the cryptocurrency discourse about the decentralisation of money and payments. All cryptocurrencies are built on a singleton ledger which is distributed across many machines. A single ledger is a point of centralisation, as is a single currency, even if there are many copies of the ledger in a distributed data architecture. Advocates of economic and financial decentralisation are very pleased to have witnessed the arrival of blockchain technologies, but cannot celebrate all the focus on a single currency with a single issuance policy (or algorithm) on a singleton ledger. Many have envisaged a multi-currency marketplace with cryptocurrencies freely competing, thus allowing for a deeper decentralisation, but progress in this direction is as slow as uptake of those alt-currencies, almost none of which have any basis for being valuable, (such as a commodity backing or legal pronouncement) nor could compete with Bitcoin in any meaningful way.\n\n\n\f\n3. Towards a monetary commons\nRachel O'Dwyer attempts to define a monetary commons thus:\n\"what we’re talking about isn’t just the implementation of a complementary currency that is held and produced in common, or the widespread re-appropriation of the production of money, but a monetary design that specifically supports forms of social and material reproduction. For example this includes health, education, and care services and from a monetary perspective, a Universal Basic Income and/or access to inexpensive credit.\"\nThere are several ideas here which would make fascinating exploration but I would like to offer a more distilled definition based on the widely held understanding that 97% of existing ‘money’ is in fact bank deposits. As we have seen, money feels to its user like property and in that sense it can be held and managed collectively. But with a deeper understanding we can see that to really own our money, we must be able to issue it and control the payments infrastructure.\nCreating a global payments infrastructure is however easy with blockchains. But creating an institution which has the right to promise money it doesn’t have, typically requires putting down a deposit of $50m before a single brick has been laid. Small banks may not be commercially viable. Then the right to issue money is highly regulated, and paying to accounts in other banks necessarily involves using other rails. So this approach could produce useful results, if done with the right intentions. The ‘ethical banks’ are small and risk-averse, limited by the amount held on deposit, and they find it hard to lend to the most worthwhile projects.\nThis paper proposes something much more radical.\nAs long as we believe the story of ‘legal tender’ we will be at the mercy of those who write the law. Legal tender, and promises to pay legal tender are highly regulated. Government give themselves the right to define money on behalf of the people, then they spend, tax, monitor, order debts be discharged in, and surveil that money. Furthermore a bank’s promise to pay legal tender can be used completely interchangeably with legal tender itself, even for payment of taxes, even if the bank is insolvent! Although legal tender is supposed to be a way that a government can issue money from nothing, accountable to parliament according to the needs of the economy, it no longer serves the economy but only the banks. Control over the quantity of money has passed to the banks who now issue 97% of it, and not to serve the economy but to maximise rent income in the form of interest.\nIt could be that there is no way to reform this system, to make it serve the real economy, to bring it back under democratic control. It could be that if we want a money system that that serves value creators rather than value extractors, unleashes potential rather than enslaving it, and which expresses the collective intention, we will need to start from scratch.\n3.1    Currency value & taxability\nWhen money is ‘backed’ that means that the issuer guarantees to exchange it for a commodity at a predetermined price. The money is in effect a warehouse receipt for, say 1 twenty-fifth of an ounce of gold. This has the effect of anchoring the value of the currency to the value of the backing commodity, which inspires confidence where it may otherwise be lacking. Most of the current wave of local currencies are backed by legal tender.\nA currency’s backing is very important to establish the legal status and also the value of a currency. If a currency can be priced unequivocally in dollars, transactions will be taxed at the dollar rate. This is entirely appropriate for a business which is doing barter as a way to get better prices of free liquidity but which otherwise measures its profit in dollars.\nIf there is no convertibility to dollars governments step beyond their philosophical remit (this is just my opinion; I’ve never heard a government attempt to justify its actions or its existence philosophically). Rather than tax the money changing hands, guidelines around LETS taxation indicate that professional work itself should be taxed, at the going rate. So I could unblock the sink of an old lady for LETS no problem, but a plumber would have to declare the work done and pay tax on the normal callout charge. It starts to get absurd. What if the plumber invoiced a nominal amount, or charged no LETS at all, or registered an unwritten favour?\nIs it legal to give my labour to a friend instead of selling it for money? Does government claim ownership of everything of value we produce? Does government determine the value everything using its own legal tender as a measure? Is any life or property possible without money being demanded from people under threat of force? This is a legal grey area that needs to be explored.\n3.2    Ledger money\nWe have seen above a kind of virtual money which exists on a ledger as the imbalance between accounts. There is no money, zero, in the ledger, but only account balances going up and down, their total always being zero.\nLedgers in banks and other corporations are used to store promises of real money, because it is easier to track and transport promises than cash. The intention is always to settle the balance at a later date with a single net payment; sometimes settlement is not even necessary if the net balance is close to zero. Sometimes these systems are said to provide liquidity because they allow payments without cash.\nA ledger used in this way, is called a credit clearing system. Before computers, all the cheques paid into the banks in one day would go to the clearing house where they would be added up and cancelled out. Banks would pay each other only the difference. Clearing means much the same even today: the hassle of moving actual money can be reduced insofar as transactions can be cleared beforehand, and this is precisely what ledgers do. And payment need never be made as long as accounts stay within a tolerable trustworthy distance of zero.\nConventional bank deposits are created on a balance sheet, thus as property, but on a ledger the payments between accounts are more like flows, or even relationships.\nLedger money is not minted or printed, it has no physical form and no fixed quantity. Starting from zero, Alice can pay Bob 10 units. Then Alice’s account is -10 and Bob’s +10. The total is zero. Bob can pay Carol, and Carol, Alice. When Alice’s balance is back to zero she can walk away, having paid and been paid without the hassle of shipping units back and forth in armoured vehicles.\nAnother way of looking at it is that spending and earning the internal currency units simultaneously creates and destroys ‘money’ such that, by definition there is always the right amount of it to represent the current credit/debit relationships.\nAlice’s having ‘owed’ the system for some time is not counted a debt and need not produce interest. In order for Bob to receive widgets before he paid widgets, someone else had to pay before they received. This is a reciprocal relationship and totally different from the commodity money paradigm in which the wealthy own all the money (or at least the right to promise what they don’t have) and rent it out to the poor. And let us not forget that what is really valuable here is not the money, but the goods and services flowing in the opposite direction!\nLedger money fulfils two of the three classical functions of money: the medium of exchange and the unit of account; but not the store of value function. Economists such as Silvio Gesell argued strongly that ‘money’ should not be intended as a long term store of value since the primary properties of money are its liquidity and virtuality. The store of value function should be performed by commodities or securitised commodities, and to expect money to perform all three functions is an error of thinking.\n3.3    Mutual credit economics\nUsing a ledger in this way, as a closed system with accounts extending credit to each other, is sometimes called mutual credit. This term focuses not so much on the clearing aspect, but on the fact that credit can be made available to anyone at any time, and the risk entailed by that credit is spread out across the whole system. In the event of an account being abandoned rather than being closed at zero, the whole system deviates from the perfect zero, and all members are affected equally when the total supply and total demand leave equilibrium.\nThis notion of economic equilibrium is a guiding principle of a mutual credit economy, and not of the global economy which is a competition to accumulate the most. Another word for economic equilibrium, is exchange, because parties give and receive in equal measure. When giving exactly equals receiving, the account balance is zero and only then may the account be closed. Since all accounts have agreed to close on zero, after Alice has paid Bob ten units, Alice is looking to earn 10 units and Bob is looking to spend ten units; thus supply equals demand. In a fiat or commodity money system, the governors, if they care, must use voodoo to calculate how much money to put into circulation for optimal trading without inflation, without bubbles, and without unemployment. In a mutual credit system this is a non-question. The political question then becomes, how much can people be trusted to deviate from zero and still return?\nThe further away a balance is from zero, the greater the risk that that account will fail to reciprocate. If no deviation were allowed there would be no liquidity and no trade. If infinite deviation was allowed, some players would only ever give and others only take. We observed earlier that supply always equals demand. Every force has an equal and opposite force. When accounts are hovering around their limits, struggling to reciprocate, that means there is equal and opposite pressure elsewhere in the system.\nA well-managed system will be able to mitigate these pressures by paying attention to those accounts and making it easier for them to trade back in the right direction.\nA poorly managed system may be lucky if negative failures to return to zero cancel out positive failures - defaults can be in either direction.\nOnce the design problem of how credit should be allocated is decided, perhaps by the people whose credit it is, which is everybody, then as much credit can be created as needed.\nAny system can of course have tweaks and redistributive mechanisms, but the fundamental properties are still important. Commodity money must be earned (or borrowed at interest) before it can be spent; the more of it you have, the better it is for you, though that might mean others are deprived. Those who have a scarce commodity (money), get more from renting it out. The day to day governance of such instruments is done through interest rate manipulation and taxing/spending, but the flagrant injustices of this paradigm are never fully mitigated by social security and other forms of redistribution.\nUsually some accounts have difficulty earning as much as they would like to spend and vice versa. Because these problems can affect the whole system, the whole system has an incentive to support those accounts, either by trading with them preferentially, redistributing credit or coming to some other arrangement. This mutual support is visible for what it is, not welfare bleeding out of the pay-packets of the people who actually work, but enabling everyone to both give and receive, which is essential for the health of the whole system.\nIt is well understood how spending locally can create a multiplier effect, and all local currencies seek to strengthen and make visible that virtuous circle. In that sense, a local currency can build solidarity within the local economy insofar as it actually diverts spending towards the local economy, which is a very difficult thing to measure.\nBut there is a deeper solidarity within a mutual credit system than within the multitude of Euro proxies which have sprung up in recent years. The value of the system depends on the engagement of the members and the quality of their experiences, which is the subject of the third paper in this series. The wealth gains that come from good governance, a glut of production and the wellbeing of the precarious members are spread around much more in a mutual credit system than in a commodity money system, where all the wealth gains are sent to the top of the pyramid as rents are adjusted.\nAll of which is why mutual credit is the money of the solidarity economy.\n3.4    Mutual credit in the real world\nAt the post WWII Bretton Woods conference, Keynes proposed that international trade be conducted through a country-to-country mutual credit system called the Bancor. The conference initially agreed the idea was sound and just, but then the USA unilaterally squashed the idea with a dollar/gold standard, then defaulted on their obligations and created the petrodollar system. Today few alternatives are discussed but the idea of going to back to the bancor has been mooted.\nThis is especially significant for an economy experiencing deflation - a scarcity of circulating money. The act of one account extending trust to another account to enable it to participate in a ‘split barter’ exchange can be seen as an act which creates liquidity. While ledgers are used throughout the financial world, there are much fewer examples of ledgers being used without the intention ever to settle, which is to say to settle debts through reciprocal exchange rather than money changing hands. \nThe most prominent is surely the business barter industry which helps businesses move unsold stock and get bums on otherwise empty seats, \nfollowed by the LETS movement which encourages the middle classes to meet each other and save money together. (French SEL, German Tauschkreis)\nfinally timebanking, in which poor and excluded people are given opportunities to support each other and build confidence. \nAt present a great many of these systems are poorly governed from a credit perspective and have a poor understanding of how mutual credit is supposed to work. Regulation within the business barter industry fails to prevent the owners of exchanges running up a deficit, which means buying all the best stuff and flooding the members with credit, and then never earning that credit back. Similar things happen in LETS and timebanks, but usually not for personal gain.\nThis has the effect that credit accumulates in members’ accounts and they want to spend, but the corresponding debit is not looking to earn. Thus the marketplace has more buyers than sellers and very often barter dollars change hands at less than parity with US dollars; inflation in these systems is a sure sign of poor governance. Bartercard national franchises do this routinely, I understand, but since their accounts are private, their innocence or guilt cannot be established.\nWhen the same things happens in LETS and timebanks, it matters much less because members depend less on these systems and are more forgiving. The governing board may decide to issue some credit to express the collective intention of the community, say to organise a festival, and the units may not be collected back in tax or entrance fees. The party account may stay negative forever and the corresponding units may slosh around creating a net positive balance in all the other accounts. Then someone might die with an equivalent positive balance and unwittingly the equilibrium is restored.\nI have heard members of business barter systems report that it didn’t work for them, never quite sure why it was so much easier to earn than spend the barter credit, members of LETS and Time banks almost always have positive experiences, often despite poor fiscal governance! The reason is because a mutual credit accounting system, accompanied by a directory of goods and services, exists to enable exchange and yields positive, productive relationships by the way. In contrast, the legal tender economy forces producers compete globally for every dollar or face poverty and shame languishing on the heap of the unemployed.\nMany members report feeling that this ledger money is easier to earn and less painful to give - it unlocks generosity.\n\n\f\n4    Federating local currencies\nThe credit commons is the notion, perhaps first voiced by Tom Greco, that local ledgers should be connected together using public infrastructure rails, with each currency retaining control of its own issuance and balance of trade, but governed cooperatively. I hope to explore the details below.\nThere have been a great many local exchange platforms created in the last few years but no sharing of code and certainly no interoperability between them. Teams who want to facilitate community exchange have given all their effort to building custom software and not enough to re-usable software and not enough to building community.\nSee the appendix for a condensed list of community exchange platforms none of which are interoperable and many of which have failed to thrive owing to lack of uptake. \nNote that while the credit commons itself is proposed to be a mutual credit system, any type of currency could participate. All that is required of a candidate member is an account for import/export and trust from existing members that the candidate will return to zero.\nThis section discusses some of the design parameters of a mutual credit federation.\n4.1    Legal Structure\nThere are pros and cons to using formal structures. For example managing a bank account in the name of an association is easier and more trusted than someone’s personal account. My vision of the credit commons is an informal association, accountable only to its members, which does not handle money at all. This is how Bitcoin works. There is no association but anyone can install some free software and just plug into the network. Later the Bitcoin Foundation was created to help grow Bitcoin but many users didn’t regard the foundation as legitimate.\nBy contrast the credit commons would embody a similar libertarian ethic, but instead of being an open system without trust, it would consist of private groups who may or may or not trust each other. Thus anyone could open an account in a credit commons, but only trusted people and groups could exchange. In this arrangement I see no benefit to registering the credit commons as an organisation, since no money should change hands and no legal recourse is needed between trusted parties.\n4.2    Governance\nThe most important governance question in a mutual credit system is to manage risk on behalf of all the members by determining the extent to which accounts can deviate from zero. Within a scarcity worldview, it is much more important to manage the negative limit both because members fear losing out and because there is more incentive to take without giving.\nSince the credit is mutually guaranteed by all member groups and by extension, all members of all member groups, it is critical that at least this part of the governing process be participative. The same principle applies in the legal tender economy, but there is no acknowledgement that it is workers who give value to money and risk management is done by banks only to maximise their profits and losses.\nAlso credit must be allocated as far as possible on a case-by-case basis. Banks are increasingly automating loan applications using algorithms, and while this is good for profits it does not serve entrepreneurs. The way to process credit applications more quickly is not through automation, but through the kind of aggregation we see in microcredit, where a loan request must be guaranteed by several people. In the credit commons a whole community would apply for credit from the collective of communities, and that community would guarantee that credit.\nThe governing process has other responsibilities, as in any community money system: managing relations and especially disputes between communities, monitoring communities who may be struggling with their balance of trade; recruiting new members, managing public perception.\nGovernance could be done by volunteers, or compensated volunteers. Any tax and any ‘wages’ could only be denominated in credit for goods and services.\nThere might be a centralised brokering service to stimulate trade, and that brokering might be paid for with taxes or transaction fees. Alternatively brokering could be done by private individuals who could earn commission, in credit.\n4.3    Nesting\nThe credit commons is an open infrastructure for community currency groups to make multilateral exchange agreements. Those groups are private and voluntary associations of individuals who may invite others to join them. Thus newcomers could not automatically join a private group but could form their own group. There could be many networks there which are not connected at all and there could be hierarchies of groups. For example all the time banks in UK could form a group to manage hours liquidity amongst themselves and Timebanks UK could be part of another group of all the national timebanking associations, also using the same unit of account, hours, which is the defining feature of timebanking.\nAt each level of organisation there would need to be a governing process comprising all its members.\nSimilarly the business barter networks could have their own arrangements in the same credit commons without touching timebanking, or as long as exchange rate mechanism is agreed, it could touch timebanking.\nThus payments from user to another might be registered at several levels depending how far in network space, the payment is going. A payment to a timebank in another country would have to obey the balance limits of both groups concerned at each level.\nThe concept of nesting credit clearing systems has also been discussed in the International Journal of Complementary Currency research\n4.4    Exchange rate mechanisms & balance limits\nThe impossible trinity applies equally to credit commons economies as to national economies:\nThe Impossible trinity (also known as the Trilemma) is a trilemma in international economics which states that it is impossible to have all three of the following at the same time:\nA stable foreign exchange rate\nFree capital movement (absence of capital controls)\nAn independent monetary policy. \nSince the credit commons is a tool for distributing political power and issuance of credit to the local level, independent monetary policy is not negotiable. A stable foreign exchange rate is maintained by curbing imports and exports, which is to say, balancing exports and imports. This gives every community an incentive to produce if wants to import and to spend if it wants to export. The designers of the Euro would have done well to apply such an ethic. Furthermore, speculation and price manipulation of currencies is contained according to the proportion of each community’s credit which is allowed to circulate outside its own accounts.\nThe post gold-standard FOREX system of currency exchange is a free market; this design has a self correcting mechanism which helps to keep prices stable. As the price of a currency deviates from its actual purchasing power, the price of goods and services in that country becomes distorted in a way that attracts trade in the opposite direction. For example, if a currency is undervalued, that country’s exports become cheaper, and demand for them increases, which drives up the currency price. This tendency towards stability is desirable in the credit commons.\nBut within that framework, it is possible for a community with a sovereign monetary policy, to stabilise its own prices using credit/debit allocated for that purpose. This is perfectly sound practice as long as the limits are respected. All communities are allowed to issue credit/debit and can use it equally for liquidity with other communities or for stabilising their own currency. In the case of fraud, damage would be limited only according to how much trust had been allocated to the rogue community, and would not be contagious.\nIn small scale systems the precise exchange rate matters much less. The largest community currency system has been running 15 years using exchange rates fixed a long time ago, and had no issues.\nThe question remains then, as explained above, how balance limits are decided between member exchanges. Greater balance limits mean greater risk, which is to say greater impact in case of failure to return to zero. Each group should decide its own process/formula through a political process. Limits should be imposed by a custom script or plugin in the accounting software and not set in stone. There are plenty of examples from which to take inspiration.\nIn the banking system it is normal to grant individuals overdrafts up to two months of salary without asking too many questions. Larger loans, for commerce and business startups, need to be scrutinised by the bank which has a mandate to be risk averse.\nEvery business barter network has its own formula or process for allocating credit, which usually takes into account the desirability of the applicants produce and their trading volume.\nWithin LETS, there are many theories about how balance limits should be determined. Typically a minimum limit is given to new members, which increases proportionately with volume of trade. \nBOX: In Western Austria 'talents' were flowing from a rural Tauschkreis to a nearby urban one and both systems on were stuck on their respective limits and in danger of freezing. They put their heads together and organised a rural festival and bussed in the city folk to spend their talents back and restore the balance.\n\n4.5    Experiences of previous federations\nThe credit commons may be a new formulation, but the federation of local currencies has been attempted many times since the emergence of LETS in the 1980s.\n4.5.1    Business barter\nThe business barter sector has many federations already because this is the business model of the software providers.\nTypically one software is sold to as many exchanges as possible and the vendor takes a dollar commission from each inter-exchange transactions, which seems inappropriate because no dollars change hands and also disincentivises exchange, more so if the fee is high.\nThis model of federation serves the software providers more than the traders because it carves up the marketplace, keeping traders separate according to their exchange’s software choice. In this way of thinking, members are property to be owned, before they are customers to be served!\nThis way also causes problems because the software providers assume that each exchanges barter dollars are worth the same without checking the integrity of the exchanges, which all to often are suffering from a profligate house account.\nThe International Reciprocal Trade Organisation sought to improve the situation by introducing another currency governed by itself, called Universal Currency. The system is its own platform and thus members have the experience of being in two exchanges and using two currencies. In 2014 the system ran into liquidity problems and fraud allegations followed. The system has now been rebooted in partnership with Bartercard, but it is not clear that the governance problems were addressed.\n4.5.2    LETS\nIn the 1990s there were several attempts to make accounting software for LETS using databases on local machines. The most valiant attempt at intertrading using Access was in Scotland where everyone was using a well developed MS Access application called SAM. The LETS of LETS was held in a separate instance of SAM and transactions were communicated by email.\nAround 2003 CES arrived, a web service allowing LETS to have their own web site in which members managed their own accounts rather than processing cheques communicating by post. CES grew quickly when it offered an intertrading mechanism between exchanges. A fixed exchange rate was calculated according to the national currency and the time-value of each exchanges unit, and this persists to this day.\nThe author of this document and CTO of Community Forge attempted to improve the CES system with an open API and in 2012 but the task was too onerous.\nSeveral LETS around Zurich are networked together with a semi automatic system which requires they all use the same platform.\n4.5.3    Timebanking\nTimebanking software has always been much more centralised than LETS being produced by the national associations rather than the communities themselves. Thus all the timebanking platforms, sharing a unit of account have enjoyed a high degree of interoperability.\nThe initial USA and UK systems were poorly built and managed and eventually both gave way to a free, well run, but closed source platform which now hosts several hundred timebanks. This means those timebanks are interoperable in theory but so far no policy exists to manage trading limits and no API to include software hosted elsewhere.\n\n\n\f\n5    Natural analogies\n5.1    A biomimicry perspective\nThis section was co-authored with Jamie Brown-Hansen.\nThe field of biomimicry is, among other things, a way of doing biology that looks for unifying patterns in the design of natural systems. There is enormous diversity in the natural world, yet biologists are able to identify certain design strategies that are common across multiple species and even kingdoms of species. Some of the deepest design patterns, in fact, can be recognised in almost all biological systems at every scale, from bacteria to multicellular organisms to entire ecosystems. These unifying patterns are referred to within the biomimicry community as Life’s Principles. They represent a design framework that has delivered thriving, regenerative systems in the natural world for 3.8 billion years, a proven recipe for long-term success within the operating conditions of this planet that we can apply where relevant in the effort to achieve sustainable human systems, including our systems of exchange.\nThe proposal of the credit commons is consistent with many of nature’s core unifying design patterns: it is bottom-up, locally attuned and adapted, diverse, decentralised, iterative, modular, and premised on quantitative stability over time. The interconnection of community-based mutual credit systems is also endorsed by the Bio-credits Working Group of the Biomimicry Global Network in answer to the question, “How would nature design a financial system?” The remainder of this section draws out some specific characteristics of the credit commons proposal that are consistent with natural system design.\n5.1.1 Locally attuned and adapted\nIn the natural world, chances of survival improve when organisms are well adapted and responsive to local conditions around them. Similarly, after decades of policy experimentation and experience, sustainable development strategists have learned that the most appropriate prescriptions for human development in any given region are attuned and adapted to local context. In the conventional bank credit system innovations in system design are templated first at the global level and make their way down to national level implementation thereafter, often without further adaptation to the contexts of individual communities.\nSome measures have shown strong correlations with good econometric outcomes across the board, such as investments in health, education and women. However, some experiences of standardised policy prescriptions applied to countries irrespective of local context have also been catastrophic. For example after the 2008 financial crisis, a committee in Basel required that banks to increase their capital requirements, which lead to a wave of debt-related suicides amongst farmers in India.\nThe credit commons starts with local innovation by communities themselves, attuned and adapted to their particular context and needs.\n5.1.2 Bottom-up development combining modular and nested components\nLiving systems assemble components one unit at a time, with development starting at the smallest scale. Simple solutions to a basic problem are nested within larger systems to form more complex entities. Starting with simple building blocks moving to more complex allows all the parts of the new system to grow and develop in response to local contexts, from the bottom up. This recalls the biological metaphor of cohabiting cells working together to form a multicellular organism. A cell is a (comparatively) simple entity and a life form in its own right. Biology gives us many examples of cells working together and specialising to make an organism with a higher degree of organisation.\nThe credit commons proposes that the economy be re-imagined from the bottom up in a self-organised manner analogous to the design process of the natural world. The power of the state to force citizens to accept its promises as money is anathema to notions of freedom of persons, and of markets. Considering the value of legal tender monies rests entirely on the productivity of the citizens, they are the natural candidates to issue promises for produce, if money be such. Systems in which a currency is imposed from the above lead to disparities in the availability of the currency, as we see in the Eurozone between Germany and Greece, for example. The biomimetic principle of designing from the bottom up would suggest every person, or more likely every economy, have its own currency for internal trade, and that complexity and scale be layered on top of that stable system.\n5.1.3    Embody resilience through systemic diversity and decentralisation \nClose to the principle of building from the bottom up is the principle of decentralisation. Many centres increases the resilience of the whole system, because it reduces dependences and single points of failure. Natural systems maintain function following disturbance by incorporating a variety of duplicate forms, processes, or systems that are not located exclusively together. \nThe Biomimicry Resource Handbook explains: “Resilience is the capacity of a system to maintain function following a disturbance. In short, it is the ability to recover after adversity. The capacity for resiliency, from bodily organs to ecosystems, often depends on the interconnectedness and functional diversity of multiple systems. When one system fails or does poorly, others can step in to compensate, either briefly or long term. As the nature of the disturbance is unpredictable, variation in strategies allows for some to endure while others may be lost. Redundancy permits the remaining to continue despite losing some, and decentralisation ensures that independent of where the disturbance falls, not all components will be subject to its impacts.”\nThe credit commons can be understood as a permaculture landscape of diverse local models interacting with each other, analogous to a natural ecosystem. A variety of locally attuned credit modules interacting in dynamic non-equilibrium is a more resilient structure than the metaphorical monoculture of today’s prevailing monetary system, according to former central banker, Bernard Lietaer.\n5.1.4    Protective membranes regulating in/out\nIn modern economies the balance of trade figure reveals how much value a country is gaining or losing. It is obtained by measuring the flow of the national currency across borders. It is very hard to obtain this figure for local or regional economies which use the same currency as their neighbours. With much more localised currencies, this figure can tell us a lot about microeconomic health and activity. Each member of a mutual credit network has a maximum extent to which its balance can deviate from zero. These limits function like a membrane of a cell, revealing the value going in and out to the wider system. In economic terms a balance-of-trade indicator is built in to each economy and the health and needs of each economy becomes visible. Limits can be set by local economy AND by the higher order system and the lowest limits respected. This affords local economies a level of protection against strong inflows or outflows of credit which would cause inflation/deflation and distort the value of their currency.\nAs the localities join together to form bioregions, and bioregions to form countries, transactions which have to pass between more balance limits, and more cultural barriers, become more cumbersome and probably more expensive. In this way the credit commons architecture favours localised exchange.\n5.1.5    Fractal design\nAs we have shown, clearing systems can be nested, with one clearing system having an account in a meta system. Smaller local modules are nested within larger regional modules, with the pattern repeated up to the global scale. This is consistent with the pattern of system design in the natural world from microorganism to biosphere. Moreover, not only are facilities in the credit commons modular and nested, they are also iterative. In other words, the same principles of organisation and engagement can be applied at each system level. This is analogous to patterns of fractal design in the nature world. \nFor example, in order for a mutual credit facility to function, all participants must agree to the principle of balanced mutual exchange. In other words, they agree to give and receive equally over the course of their membership in the credit community. Concretely, this can mean, for example, that participants must start with a balance of zero, and end with a balance of zero. This principle applies not just to individual participants in a local credit community, but also to local communities participating in a regional credit facility, and so on up to the global level. In the case of a regional facility, each local community agrees to balance its imports and exports in order to participate; the same principle applied at the next level.\n\nWe would suggest around 4 levels of nesting ranging from local systems to bioregional systems, to national or linguistic regions, to a world clearing system. This allows the same mechanism to serve at all scales of the economy and probably provides a bias towards more local trade, since currencies are more valuable nearer to where they can be spent. \n5.2    Money as flows in a field\nIt is tempting when exploring the True nature of money, as theologians study the bread in the Eucharist, to study the tokens and the exchanges. One popular approach is to posit a substance called 'value' which resides in the tokens, either intrinsically because the tokens are made of some valuable stuff (use value), or by government decree (exchange value). This is reminiscent of the theory of transubstantiation in which the bread somehow 'changes' into into the body of Christ.\nBut this whole approach assumes that money is some kind of stuff which moves from hand to hand. Even fiat money is a commodity insofar as it is valued for itself more than for what it can buy.\nWhen we look at the different ways of issuing money, we see clearly that 97% of modern money is NOT a commodity. It comes from nothing and exists only on bank balance sheets. This is accounting money, the kind used in mutual credit systems. And it has some other interesting properties:\nFor every unit of money created as a liability, there is a corresponding asset created with equal and opposite value\nThe money flows into circulation and at the appointed time some money - not necessarily the same money is pulled out of circulation and cancelled out against the asset, leaving nothing.\nWhen we look at cash we might imagine each piece moves around the economy independently of other money, like a ball bouncing randomly around a pinball machine. But with accounting money you can't mark the bills and track one piece of money just like you can't pinpoint an electron. A better analogy is a field.\nIt turns out that money is very like energy. By studying the substance we miss the wood for the trees. The paradox of money-as-a-commodity and money-as-a-promise is resolved once money is regarded as a circuit or as a wave acting in a field. It is created when no-value splits into assets and liabilities, just like when a neutral photon breaks into a positron and an electron which go spinning off in different directions and times. Money can be seen like electrons leaping from atom to atom, but look at the whole picture and money flows like a wave in a field, pushing waves before it and pulling waves behind it. What matters is not the atoms or the leaping, but the integrity and balance of the circuit. \nAt least, that's when it works.\nWhen we treat money as a commodity, the flows get out of sync. When we hoard money and relend the same money twice we prevent it from returning to source. When we just read the peaks and not the troughs, we miss the coming tsunami.\nWhen, for cultural reasons, borrowers take all the responsibility and risk, while lenders charge rent on their absent 'property' the two parties will never dance well together, leading to gluts and dearths and arhythmia.\nCredit money, or accounting money is very much like electricity, and the conceptual leap if we want master it is the same leap as from Newtonian mechanics to Quantum mechanics.\n\n\n\f\nConclusion\nThere are no reliable statistics, but since the financial system transitioned into the realm of fiction in 2008, the present author has witnessed a noticeable growth in complementary currency activities. The LETS have been declining since at least the turn of the century. Time banking has benefitted from institutional support and more favourable legal rulings, and there are several projects which fit neither family. I judge that the success rate of currency projects remains very low. This is because most complementary currencies are started by an isolated enthusiast, but they can only succeed when many people actively participate. Awareness that money itself may not be a neutral commodity is certainly growing, but that understanding is a long way from making a conscious decision to invest effort in the local economy, and to do so outside of legal tender money.\nIt will be argued therefore, that the very notion of a local economy is so eroded in a global society, and money itself so aspatial, and local money systems so lacklustre that there is nothing to federate.\nBut it can also be argued that a credit commons would strengthen all the local systems, giving them new uses and wider relevance. Local currencies would undoubtedly be more useful if they could be spent in other localities. In addition, the process of making local systems interoperable will increase awareness about how money systems could be run, and what is possible once we learn to cooperate.\nFinally, human architectures of exchange may be better positioned to serve as an organ of planetary ecology, fostering global conditions conducive to biological life, if their patterns of development are consistent with the bottom-up pattern of systems innovation in the natural world. The consistency of design principles can allow human and natural systems to flow more seamlessly together so that “the city can no longer be distinguished from the forest” from a systems design perspective. \nEnough open source software already exists (some created by the author of this document) for local communities to design and own local exchanges. What is needed, I surmise, is \na blockchain protocol, which allows people to organise their promises in the ways described above, and some requirements and explorations will be in the next paper;\nand crucially, to raise awareness of actionable solutions to the monetary paradox and how to implement them for growing numbers of local solidarity groups.\n\n\f\n"

Bitcoin’s release shortly after the financial crisis in 2008 created a vibrant new discourse around disintermediating banks, open payment protocols, and the nature of money itself. Bitcoin has many problems and isn’t really a solution, but our collective learning from it has been huge. This paper proposes a new bottom up monetary infrastructure, the Credit Commons, which already exists in fragments, and better reflects and supports the values and structures of the ‘solidarity economy’\nThe suggestion is not principally that ‘we’ can ‘change’ the money system and hence the economy, although there is some truth to that. But more importantly to point out that such a thing as a ‘solidarity economy’ cannot be built on the current globalised debt-money system; and the kind of money needed for a more beautiful world can be assembled without permission of states, without legal force, and without high running costs."

        "text": "Global credit expansion of the magnitude which commenced under Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher and which continues to this day is premised on indefinite economic growth, which is defined as an increase in Gross Domestic Product, or the amount of money changing hands. This a convenient measure for the government because it directly correlates with taxation, but it also in practice corresponds to the rate of resource extraction and CO2 emissions. If and when economic growth does not keep pace with interest repayment demands, the issuance of new debt lags behind debt repayments and the volume of money decreases, stalling the economy. Since 2008 bank lending to productive enterprise has slowed as banks use increasingly cheap money not to re-lend as the government begs them, but to shore up the titanic holes in their balance sheets, which, if officially acknowledged would mean the whole banking sector was insolvent. The real economy is being sacrificed to cover previous reckless profiteering of the financial sector."

By turns they are doing both: cutting social spending in order to pay off debts, and increasing debt by injecting new money into bank balance sheets in the hope that banks will lend money into circulation. Interest rates have been lowered to near zero to enable or encourage ever greater borrowing. Overall public debts are still increasing which makes nonsense out of the austerity narrative. Only when we understand that money can be something other than commercial credit can we see ways out of the dilemma, the most obvious of which is to contain bank lending and have government issue ‘sovereign’ money instead which is how most people still think money is issued."

All developed economies have followed Japan into the deflationary trap; the only way out that we know is from out 1930s experience, when the threat and reality of WWII lead to massive borrowing and full employment, otherwise permanent recession.\nDeflation means that more money is being paid back to banks than is being borrowed from banks. When this ‘debt’ money is repaid, it cancels out on the bank’s balance sheet and no longer exists. The amount of money (circulating) in the world is going down, which means less employment, less money in people’s pockets, less demand for goods and services, and lower prices."

        "text": "1.2    Popular responses to the economic malaise\nFrom the 19th Century we still have cooperatives and mutual benefit societies, some of which are thriving. The expression ‘solidarity economy’ emerged from South America and has spread to Europe, and it describes that subset of institutions which value things other than profit. In Spain the integral cooperatives are growing. Also Europe has an degrowth movement with an annual conference. In USA the Italian slow food initiative has been augmented with a slow money initiative. In Austria there is the Economy for the Common Good movement in which businesses audit themselves using a tool similar to triple bottom line accounting.\nFortunately the Great Recession seems to have fueled a range of other discourses which are rarely presented in the mainstream media. \nThere has been a renewed interest in simpler more transparent, more direct financial services. The Move Your Money campaign saw an encouraging movement out of banks and into credit unions but seemingly not enough to have systemic impact. Many social startups and government sponsored experiments are vying to revolutionise finance, investment, and payments with new models such as crowdfunding things banks won’t fund, and peer-to-peer lending which cuts out the bank as an intermediary.\nSuch new financial services could point the way towards a new economy with less speculation and rent-collecting intermediaries, but they do nothing for the present crisis in which money issued as interest bearing debt is draining out of circulation as new loans are less than repayments.\nBitcoin seemed to offer a democratisation of money with a ledger which could not be hacked, new coins being issued to those who invested in securing the network, the possibility of privacy in transactions, and low transaction charges. But the many benefits have not offset other concerns: price instability, the punitive legal judgements, fear-mongering in the financial press, and latterly serious governance issues. Having been designed as a sort of digital gold, Bitcoin suffers from many of the same flaws as gold-money. Any money-as-commodity is vulnerable to hoarding, speculation and throttling by the wealthiest players in the market.\nRachel O’Dwyer puts it more forcefully\n\"It would seem that Bitcoin, far from representing a monetary commons, is instead an ideal financial asset for rent-seeking capitalism. Because of its design there is also no possibility for cheap credit in the Bitcoin system and if the unit matures, a banking system will be necessary to provide credit based on deposits.\"\nBitcoin’s market capitalisation represents nearly $5bn (November 2015) of a new highly liquid commodity. This is a drop in the ocean of quantitative easing, and its lack of circulation means Bitcoin as money is not really mitigating the crisis.\n\nTransition towns and ecovillages across Europe are increasingly aware of the importance of economic development to their wider goals. This movement wide awakening only translates into a small number of dedicated individuals, and the legal, & software tools they need barely yet exist.\nMany local organisations, especially in France, have created their own local currencies. Most of these are 'backed' by legal tender, which means they may serve to nudge shoppers into local procurement, but they neither increase liquidity nor transfer legitimacy from criminal institutions to trusted sources of credit/money.\nIf all this gives grounds for hope I would like to temper it by observing two things which have held true since the roman empire:\ntechnological unemployment means that there is less and less human effort needed to sustain life. This would be a good thing if opportunities to work (or at least to benefit from the work machines do) were properly distributed.\nthe wealthiest people have access to unlimited money and credit with which to buy, out-invest or undercut any competition\nHowever productive the workers are, rent always increases commensurately confiscating much of the wealth created. Despite many rags-to-riches tales of social mobility, most productive people will never control the wealth they produce unless they first own the means of production, and ultimately the land which brings food sovereignty.\nFew solutions then, are recognising the power and role of banks or addressing the (economic) root causes of poverty. We may seek political solutions, but we also need to find ways to withdraw our patronage en masse. \nIn section two we will look in more detail at bank-money and how banks control the main function of money, payments. \n1.3     Resourcing the solidarity economy\nFor many years, impassioned activists have been making reasonable arguments about the need for a Green New Deal, or pointing out how the Military industrial complex does not increase the security of ordinary people.\nBut no argument seems to divert the constant flow of money towards what Buckminster Fuller called life-sustaining projects from war, bureaucracy, decadence, and propping up insolvent banks. Governments who used to provide essential infrastructure now expect private companies to build everything with private capital. Private capital flows on the basis of profitability alone, its dearth of ethics being applauded by neoliberal fundamentalists.\nThe assumption that the market will meet all needs, means the ones who can’t even get to the market are discounted, left to charities and do-gooders. Similarly environmental, spiritual, cultural, and humanitarian projects with no intention to make a profit are regarded as marginal, more so in an economic ‘downturn’. \nThe situation is further hindered by laws which prevent the unemployed from volunteering, and nonprofits from taking unpaid volunteers.\nNot to deny the importance of money, many organisations are failing to tap into a wealth of resources lying idle in their communities. Pensioners, lonely and bored, people on sick pay who can work but maybe not take responsibility, and even unemployed could be engaged discreetly. What is lacking is the organisation to put volunteers in useful work the emotional hooks to motivate them, and the means to reward volunteers, whether it be a sense of ownership or entitlement, or the ability to access goods and services.\nIn short, as the formal economy shrinks, valuable labour and all kinds of resources are left idle as need grows. The solidarity economy can grow by matching the unmet needs and unused resources, which is one of the core messages of timebanking. Insofar as money is NOT used, producers own their produce, and need submit neither accounts nor tax returns, nor repay debt nor comply with all kinds of legislation.\nWe have some examples, some templates and tools, mostly not very modern, of what such an economy can look like. The cooperative movement has been huge. Great solidarity is witnessed in the aftermath of natural disasters. There are ecovillages, social enterprises, charity also has a role to play. But all the pieces are scattered\nTo conclude this section I invite you to consider Chilean economist Manfred Max Neef’s vision of a bottom up financial system:\nThe financial institutions that may be concerned with local financing of Human Scale Development must state goals and forms of operation going far beyond conventional principles. In the first place, these institutions must promote local creativity and support community initiatives that are organized through solidarity, horizontal and equitable relationships. Second, they must encourage the greatest possible circulation of money at the local level. This means attracting locally generated surpluses and making them circulate as many times as possible within the local space, thus increasing the multiplier effect of a given level of deposits and savings. Third, these institutions must adjust themselves so that the savers, or the generators of surpluses, may decide on the use of their resources, thus allowing for a greater transparency in the relationship between saver and investor that may, in turn, promote greater participation in activities devoted to making development alternatives in the local space more viable. Fourth, these financial institutions must be managed in a cooperative way by people in the community itself, which means that the management should also be local in origin. Finally, if the local financial institution is to gain credibility, it must be protected against any potential liquidity crisis.\nWho among us even knows how to build a financial institution? Before that we need to re-learn how to trust and cooperate, how to give and receive, how to put down our own projects to move further, faster with others’. \n\f\n2    Understanding payments infrastructure\n2.1     Ledgers and rails\nThe coins jangling in our pockets and the paper furled in our wallets, feel to their bearers like a commodity which can be exchanged for other commodities, as if they had value-in-themselves. And in a very practical sense, if not in a legal one, we do own they money in our pockets. But most money is not in the form of cash but in the form of bank deposits, which is something else entirely. As with money, we need to know who has the right to create bank deposits, and who gives value to bank deposits, by what law banks are allowed to subtract them from our accounts, and how transaction charges can be so high 6 years since the invention of blockchains. Bank deposits behave much less like a commodity than money - it is created from nothing as a liability, it is always owned by the bank and can only move within a legally defined infrastructure. The balance in my account is merely the promise of the bank to give me cash if it is able, and if it wants to. The 97% of modern money which is bank deposits is privately owned in the sense that it is issued at the discretion of, at a price determined by, and for the profit of, private banking institutions.\nBut banks do not only store money and earn rent on credit issued ex nihilo. Banks also perform the other function of money which is making payments, and earn vast sums from doing so. Moving money is as simple as debiting one account and crediting another. We can see how this works in Western Union where cash is paid in office and paid out of another office in another country moments later. It is clear the actual money wasn’t transferred between franchise outlets, only the promise of it. All banking networks and within banks are working with these promises, of money, of gold, of other promises.\nNote that a ledger entry does not cause real money to change hands. The ledger’s unit of account is a virtual money or a promise to pay ‘real money’. For that reason, in banking, ‘pay’ means the same as ‘promise to pay’ or ‘transfer a promise to pay’.\nA ledger, in the sense that I mean it, is merely a list of transactions between accounts. Because every transaction is a subtraction from one account and an addition to another, the sum of all accounts must necessarily be zero, thus a ledger has a sort of built-in integrity.\nA ledger records payments between accounts by simply adding a line. The money, or the promise can by definition only be in one place at one time. There is no duplication possible. Whether the ledger is on paper, on a single spreadsheet, or in a single table database it is integral in a way that two ledgers might not be.\nBetween accounts in one ledger, payments take place instantaneously and definitively. A ledger is often likened to a railway network in which carriages flow easily between endpoints. But this is only as useful as the ledger is large. Each bank keeps its own ledger but payments between banks and between countries present a technical challenge of ensuring the integrity of the accounts. Payments must be certain to ‘leave’ one ledger and enter another despite typically running on different computers with different software and different owners. And there needs to be an audit trail. There must be no chance of payments derailing and not arriving, or of payments arriving without leaving anywhere!\nStrong technology and legal oversight exists to ensure sure that both organisations’ auditors agree on the accounts and that promises were not lost or duplicated as they streamed from ledger to ledger and from database to database and from network to network, and that everything is reported to the authorities.\nThe obvious solution is ledger of ledgers, which only banks can connect to and in many cases is owed by a cooperative of those banks, such as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, SWIFT.\nNeedless to say, banking rails which are plugged into the global financial network are tightly controlled and expensive.\nThat is why banks regard their rails as private property and charge rent for the use of them.\n2.2    Monopolies and blockchains\n\"Whoever controls the data centre exercises political and economic control over communications. It’s difficult to see how we can counteract these recentralising tendencies in order to build a common core infrastructure... barriers include the age-old problem of scaling distributed forms of organisation beyond the local\"\nIt is important to note that a ledger has to be owned and someone had to be trusted to maintain the ledger with integrity. A ledger owner has the power to move money between accounts, to inspect, edit, delete, deny and crucially, siphon off transaction fees (or any charges).\nMany thinkers believe that certain types of infrastructure should be excluded from the realm of competition because the duplication of those services creates huge complexities and inefficiencies. Those services, they argue, should be run by the state. But this reasoning went to the wall in the ongoing orgy of privatisation started in the 1980s. The notion of rails reminds Englishmen of the British Rail, a natural monopoly owned by the government which was privatised by ruling ideologues in the 1990s. There were price rises, safety concerns, large profits, and even now station staff can often find better prices than the computerised booking system. But I would point out that even in the midst of this farce, the rails were still managed by one company, Railtrack.\nI know of no Western government which owns its payment rails outside the postal service. This critical infrastructure is almost all owned by private corporations. This ‘natural’ cartel would have us believe that the only way to move ‘money’ is to own or rent the rails from payer to payee. Many small, specialist and startup payments companies with no rails of their own pay to piggy-back on the rails of one of these corporations because building another set of rails would be prohibitively expensive.\nThe Islamic system of Hawala takes a different approach. Instead of infrastructure to guarantee the system integrity, hawala relies on trust and the personal reputations of the agents at either end. This has the unfortunate consequence of avoiding any rails, transaction charges and surveillance, which has put this ancient low-tech system on the wrong side of post 9/11 anti-money-laundering laws dictated to the world by the US banking system jealous of our privacy.\n2.3    A note on Bitcoin\nAll I’ve said until now should help to explain the disruptive potential of blockchain technologies. Its success would mean the obviation of whole payments cartel. \nThe Bitcoin infrastructure is not owned, but is a de-facto commons. This raises difficult questions about governance, which became a serious problem when a fork, Bitcoin XT was proposed. Decisions in Bitcoin are taken democratically, not with one person/one vote, but one miner/one vote. The owners of the mining machines are not representative of all Bitcoin’s stakeholders. The major dilemma in the community is now whether to develop the system towards greater adoption by complying with regulation, or to continue in the legal grey areas but upholding libertarian ideals.\nThere is much confusion in the cryptocurrency discourse about the decentralisation of money and payments. All cryptocurrencies are built on a singleton ledger which is distributed across many machines. A single ledger is a point of centralisation, as is a single currency, even if there are many copies of the ledger in a distributed data architecture. Advocates of economic and financial decentralisation are very pleased to have witnessed the arrival of blockchain technologies, but cannot celebrate all the focus on a single currency with a single issuance policy (or algorithm) on a singleton ledger. Many have envisaged a multi-currency marketplace with cryptocurrencies freely competing, thus allowing for a deeper decentralisation, but progress in this direction is as slow as uptake of those alt-currencies, almost none of which have any basis for being valuable, (such as a commodity backing or legal pronouncement) nor could compete with Bitcoin in any meaningful way.\n\n\n\f\n3. Towards a monetary commons\nRachel O'Dwyer attempts to define a monetary commons thus:\n\"what we’re talking about isn’t just the implementation of a complementary currency that is held and produced in common, or the widespread re-appropriation of the production of money, but a monetary design that specifically supports forms of social and material reproduction. For example this includes health, education, and care services and from a monetary perspective, a Universal Basic Income and/or access to inexpensive credit.\"\nThere are several ideas here which would make fascinating exploration but I would like to offer a more distilled definition based on the widely held understanding that 97% of existing ‘money’ is in fact bank deposits. As we have seen, money feels to its user like property and in that sense it can be held and managed collectively. But with a deeper understanding we can see that to really own our money, we must be able to issue it and control the payments infrastructure.\nCreating a global payments infrastructure is however easy with blockchains. But creating an institution which has the right to promise money it doesn’t have, typically requires putting down a deposit of $50m before a single brick has been laid. Small banks may not be commercially viable. Then the right to issue money is highly regulated, and paying to accounts in other banks necessarily involves using other rails. So this approach could produce useful results, if done with the right intentions. The ‘ethical banks’ are small and risk-averse, limited by the amount held on deposit, and they find it hard to lend to the most worthwhile projects.\nThis paper proposes something much more radical.\nAs long as we believe the story of ‘legal tender’ we will be at the mercy of those who write the law. Legal tender, and promises to pay legal tender are highly regulated. Government give themselves the right to define money on behalf of the people, then they spend, tax, monitor, order debts be discharged in, and surveil that money. Furthermore a bank’s promise to pay legal tender can be used completely interchangeably with legal tender itself, even for payment of taxes, even if the bank is insolvent! Although legal tender is supposed to be a way that a government can issue money from nothing, accountable to parliament according to the needs of the economy, it no longer serves the economy but only the banks. Control over the quantity of money has passed to the banks who now issue 97% of it, and not to serve the economy but to maximise rent income in the form of interest.\nIt could be that there is no way to reform this system, to make it serve the real economy, to bring it back under democratic control. It could be that if we want a money system that that serves value creators rather than value extractors, unleashes potential rather than enslaving it, and which expresses the collective intention, we will need to start from scratch.\n3.1    Currency value & taxability\nWhen money is ‘backed’ that means that the issuer guarantees to exchange it for a commodity at a predetermined price. The money is in effect a warehouse receipt for, say 1 twenty-fifth of an ounce of gold. This has the effect of anchoring the value of the currency to the value of the backing commodity, which inspires confidence where it may otherwise be lacking. Most of the current wave of local currencies are backed by legal tender.\nA currency’s backing is very important to establish the legal status and also the value of a currency. If a currency can be priced unequivocally in dollars, transactions will be taxed at the dollar rate. This is entirely appropriate for a business which is doing barter as a way to get better prices of free liquidity but which otherwise measures its profit in dollars.\nIf there is no convertibility to dollars governments step beyond their philosophical remit (this is just my opinion; I’ve never heard a government attempt to justify its actions or its existence philosophically). Rather than tax the money changing hands, guidelines around LETS taxation indicate that professional work itself should be taxed, at the going rate. So I could unblock the sink of an old lady for LETS no problem, but a plumber would have to declare the work done and pay tax on the normal callout charge. It starts to get absurd. What if the plumber invoiced a nominal amount, or charged no LETS at all, or registered an unwritten favour?\nIs it legal to give my labour to a friend instead of selling it for money? Does government claim ownership of everything of value we produce? Does government determine the value everything using its own legal tender as a measure? Is any life or property possible without money being demanded from people under threat of force? This is a legal grey area that needs to be explored.\n3.2    Ledger money\nWe have seen above a kind of virtual money which exists on a ledger as the imbalance between accounts. There is no money, zero, in the ledger, but only account balances going up and down, their total always being zero.\nLedgers in banks and other corporations are used to store promises of real money, because it is easier to track and transport promises than cash. The intention is always to settle the balance at a later date with a single net payment; sometimes settlement is not even necessary if the net balance is close to zero. Sometimes these systems are said to provide liquidity because they allow payments without cash.\nA ledger used in this way, is called a credit clearing system. Before computers, all the cheques paid into the banks in one day would go to the clearing house where they would be added up and cancelled out. Banks would pay each other only the difference. Clearing means much the same even today: the hassle of moving actual money can be reduced insofar as transactions can be cleared beforehand, and this is precisely what ledgers do. And payment need never be made as long as accounts stay within a tolerable trustworthy distance of zero.\nConventional bank deposits are created on a balance sheet, thus as property, but on a ledger the payments between accounts are more like flows, or even relationships.\nLedger money is not minted or printed, it has no physical form and no fixed quantity. Starting from zero, Alice can pay Bob 10 units. Then Alice’s account is -10 and Bob’s +10. The total is zero. Bob can pay Carol, and Carol, Alice. When Alice’s balance is back to zero she can walk away, having paid and been paid without the hassle of shipping units back and forth in armoured vehicles.\nAnother way of looking at it is that spending and earning the internal currency units simultaneously creates and destroys ‘money’ such that, by definition there is always the right amount of it to represent the current credit/debit relationships.\nAlice’s having ‘owed’ the system for some time is not counted a debt and need not produce interest. In order for Bob to receive widgets before he paid widgets, someone else had to pay before they received. This is a reciprocal relationship and totally different from the commodity money paradigm in which the wealthy own all the money (or at least the right to promise what they don’t have) and rent it out to the poor. And let us not forget that what is really valuable here is not the money, but the goods and services flowing in the opposite direction!\nLedger money fulfils two of the three classical functions of money: the medium of exchange and the unit of account; but not the store of value function. Economists such as Silvio Gesell argued strongly that ‘money’ should not be intended as a long term store of value since the primary properties of money are its liquidity and virtuality. The store of value function should be performed by commodities or securitised commodities, and to expect money to perform all three functions is an error of thinking.\n3.3    Mutual credit economics\nUsing a ledger in this way, as a closed system with accounts extending credit to each other, is sometimes called mutual credit. This term focuses not so much on the clearing aspect, but on the fact that credit can be made available to anyone at any time, and the risk entailed by that credit is spread out across the whole system. In the event of an account being abandoned rather than being closed at zero, the whole system deviates from the perfect zero, and all members are affected equally when the total supply and total demand leave equilibrium.\nThis notion of economic equilibrium is a guiding principle of a mutual credit economy, and not of the global economy which is a competition to accumulate the most. Another word for economic equilibrium, is exchange, because parties give and receive in equal measure. When giving exactly equals receiving, the account balance is zero and only then may the account be closed. Since all accounts have agreed to close on zero, after Alice has paid Bob ten units, Alice is looking to earn 10 units and Bob is looking to spend ten units; thus supply equals demand. In a fiat or commodity money system, the governors, if they care, must use voodoo to calculate how much money to put into circulation for optimal trading without inflation, without bubbles, and without unemployment. In a mutual credit system this is a non-question. The political question then becomes, how much can people be trusted to deviate from zero and still return?\nThe further away a balance is from zero, the greater the risk that that account will fail to reciprocate. If no deviation were allowed there would be no liquidity and no trade. If infinite deviation was allowed, some players would only ever give and others only take. We observed earlier that supply always equals demand. Every force has an equal and opposite force. When accounts are hovering around their limits, struggling to reciprocate, that means there is equal and opposite pressure elsewhere in the system.\nA well-managed system will be able to mitigate these pressures by paying attention to those accounts and making it easier for them to trade back in the right direction.\nA poorly managed system may be lucky if negative failures to return to zero cancel out positive failures - defaults can be in either direction.\nOnce the design problem of how credit should be allocated is decided, perhaps by the people whose credit it is, which is everybody, then as much credit can be created as needed.\nAny system can of course have tweaks and redistributive mechanisms, but the fundamental properties are still important. Commodity money must be earned (or borrowed at interest) before it can be spent; the more of it you have, the better it is for you, though that might mean others are deprived. Those who have a scarce commodity (money), get more from renting it out. The day to day governance of such instruments is done through interest rate manipulation and taxing/spending, but the flagrant injustices of this paradigm are never fully mitigated by social security and other forms of redistribution.\nUsually some accounts have difficulty earning as much as they would like to spend and vice versa. Because these problems can affect the whole system, the whole system has an incentive to support those accounts, either by trading with them preferentially, redistributing credit or coming to some other arrangement. This mutual support is visible for what it is, not welfare bleeding out of the pay-packets of the people who actually work, but enabling everyone to both give and receive, which is essential for the health of the whole system.\nIt is well understood how spending locally can create a multiplier effect, and all local currencies seek to strengthen and make visible that virtuous circle. In that sense, a local currency can build solidarity within the local economy insofar as it actually diverts spending towards the local economy, which is a very difficult thing to measure.\nBut there is a deeper solidarity within a mutual credit system than within the multitude of Euro proxies which have sprung up in recent years. The value of the system depends on the engagement of the members and the quality of their experiences, which is the subject of the third paper in this series. The wealth gains that come from good governance, a glut of production and the wellbeing of the precarious members are spread around much more in a mutual credit system than in a commodity money system, where all the wealth gains are sent to the top of the pyramid as rents are adjusted.\nAll of which is why mutual credit is the money of the solidarity economy.\n3.4    Mutual credit in the real world\nAt the post WWII Bretton Woods conference, Keynes proposed that international trade be conducted through a country-to-country mutual credit system called the Bancor. The conference initially agreed the idea was sound and just, but then the USA unilaterally squashed the idea with a dollar/gold standard, then defaulted on their obligations and created the petrodollar system. Today few alternatives are discussed but the idea of going to back to the bancor has been mooted.\nThis is especially significant for an economy experiencing deflation - a scarcity of circulating money. The act of one account extending trust to another account to enable it to participate in a ‘split barter’ exchange can be seen as an act which creates liquidity. While ledgers are used throughout the financial world, there are much fewer examples of ledgers being used without the intention ever to settle, which is to say to settle debts through reciprocal exchange rather than money changing hands. \nThe most prominent is surely the business barter industry which helps businesses move unsold stock and get bums on otherwise empty seats, \nfollowed by the LETS movement which encourages the middle classes to meet each other and save money together. (French SEL, German Tauschkreis)\nfinally timebanking, in which poor and excluded people are given opportunities to support each other and build confidence. \nAt present a great many of these systems are poorly governed from a credit perspective and have a poor understanding of how mutual credit is supposed to work. Regulation within the business barter industry fails to prevent the owners of exchanges running up a deficit, which means buying all the best stuff and flooding the members with credit, and then never earning that credit back. Similar things happen in LETS and timebanks, but usually not for personal gain.\nThis has the effect that credit accumulates in members’ accounts and they want to spend, but the corresponding debit is not looking to earn. Thus the marketplace has more buyers than sellers and very often barter dollars change hands at less than parity with US dollars; inflation in these systems is a sure sign of poor governance. Bartercard national franchises do this routinely, I understand, but since their accounts are private, their innocence or guilt cannot be established.\nWhen the same things happens in LETS and timebanks, it matters much less because members depend less on these systems and are more forgiving. The governing board may decide to issue some credit to express the collective intention of the community, say to organise a festival, and the units may not be collected back in tax or entrance fees. The party account may stay negative forever and the corresponding units may slosh around creating a net positive balance in all the other accounts. Then someone might die with an equivalent positive balance and unwittingly the equilibrium is restored.\nI have heard members of business barter systems report that it didn’t work for them, never quite sure why it was so much easier to earn than spend the barter credit, members of LETS and Time banks almost always have positive experiences, often despite poor fiscal governance! The reason is because a mutual credit accounting system, accompanied by a directory of goods and services, exists to enable exchange and yields positive, productive relationships by the way. In contrast, the legal tender economy forces producers compete globally for every dollar or face poverty and shame languishing on the heap of the unemployed.\nMany members report feeling that this ledger money is easier to earn and less painful to give - it unlocks generosity.\n\n\f\n4    Federating local currencies\nThe credit commons is the notion, perhaps first voiced by Tom Greco, that local ledgers should be connected together using public infrastructure rails, with each currency retaining control of its own issuance and balance of trade, but governed cooperatively. I hope to explore the details below.\nThere have been a great many local exchange platforms created in the last few years but no sharing of code and certainly no interoperability between them. Teams who want to facilitate community exchange have given all their effort to building custom software and not enough to re-usable software and not enough to building community.\nSee the appendix for a condensed list of community exchange platforms none of which are interoperable and many of which have failed to thrive owing to lack of uptake. \nNote that while the credit commons itself is proposed to be a mutual credit system, any type of currency could participate. All that is required of a candidate member is an account for import/export and trust from existing members that the candidate will return to zero.\nThis section discusses some of the design parameters of a mutual credit federation.\n4.1    Legal Structure\nThere are pros and cons to using formal structures. For example managing a bank account in the name of an association is easier and more trusted than someone’s personal account. My vision of the credit commons is an informal association, accountable only to its members, which does not handle money at all. This is how Bitcoin works. There is no association but anyone can install some free software and just plug into the network. Later the Bitcoin Foundation was created to help grow Bitcoin but many users didn’t regard the foundation as legitimate.\nBy contrast the credit commons would embody a similar libertarian ethic, but instead of being an open system without trust, it would consist of private groups who may or may or not trust each other. Thus anyone could open an account in a credit commons, but only trusted people and groups could exchange. In this arrangement I see no benefit to registering the credit commons as an organisation, since no money should change hands and no legal recourse is needed between trusted parties.\n4.2    Governance\nThe most important governance question in a mutual credit system is to manage risk on behalf of all the members by determining the extent to which accounts can deviate from zero. Within a scarcity worldview, it is much more important to manage the negative limit both because members fear losing out and because there is more incentive to take without giving.\nSince the credit is mutually guaranteed by all member groups and by extension, all members of all member groups, it is critical that at least this part of the governing process be participative. The same principle applies in the legal tender economy, but there is no acknowledgement that it is workers who give value to money and risk management is done by banks only to maximise their profits and losses.\nAlso credit must be allocated as far as possible on a case-by-case basis. Banks are increasingly automating loan applications using algorithms, and while this is good for profits it does not serve entrepreneurs. The way to process credit applications more quickly is not through automation, but through the kind of aggregation we see in microcredit, where a loan request must be guaranteed by several people. In the credit commons a whole community would apply for credit from the collective of communities, and that community would guarantee that credit.\nThe governing process has other responsibilities, as in any community money system: managing relations and especially disputes between communities, monitoring communities who may be struggling with their balance of trade; recruiting new members, managing public perception.\nGovernance could be done by volunteers, or compensated volunteers. Any tax and any ‘wages’ could only be denominated in credit for goods and services.\nThere might be a centralised brokering service to stimulate trade, and that brokering might be paid for with taxes or transaction fees. Alternatively brokering could be done by private individuals who could earn commission, in credit.\n4.3    Nesting\nThe credit commons is an open infrastructure for community currency groups to make multilateral exchange agreements. Those groups are private and voluntary associations of individuals who may invite others to join them. Thus newcomers could not automatically join a private group but could form their own group. There could be many networks there which are not connected at all and there could be hierarchies of groups. For example all the time banks in UK could form a group to manage hours liquidity amongst themselves and Timebanks UK could be part of another group of all the national timebanking associations, also using the same unit of account, hours, which is the defining feature of timebanking.\nAt each level of organisation there would need to be a governing process comprising all its members.\nSimilarly the business barter networks could have their own arrangements in the same credit commons without touching timebanking, or as long as exchange rate mechanism is agreed, it could touch timebanking.\nThus payments from user to another might be registered at several levels depending how far in network space, the payment is going. A payment to a timebank in another country would have to obey the balance limits of both groups concerned at each level.\nThe concept of nesting credit clearing systems has also been discussed in the International Journal of Complementary Currency research\n4.4    Exchange rate mechanisms & balance limits\nThe impossible trinity applies equally to credit commons economies as to national economies:\nThe Impossible trinity (also known as the Trilemma) is a trilemma in international economics which states that it is impossible to have all three of the following at the same time:\nA stable foreign exchange rate\nFree capital movement (absence of capital controls)\nAn independent monetary policy. \nSince the credit commons is a tool for distributing political power and issuance of credit to the local level, independent monetary policy is not negotiable. A stable foreign exchange rate is maintained by curbing imports and exports, which is to say, balancing exports and imports. This gives every community an incentive to produce if wants to import and to spend if it wants to export. The designers of the Euro would have done well to apply such an ethic. Furthermore, speculation and price manipulation of currencies is contained according to the proportion of each community’s credit which is allowed to circulate outside its own accounts.\nThe post gold-standard FOREX system of currency exchange is a free market; this design has a self correcting mechanism which helps to keep prices stable. As the price of a currency deviates from its actual purchasing power, the price of goods and services in that country becomes distorted in a way that attracts trade in the opposite direction. For example, if a currency is undervalued, that country’s exports become cheaper, and demand for them increases, which drives up the currency price. This tendency towards stability is desirable in the credit commons.\nBut within that framework, it is possible for a community with a sovereign monetary policy, to stabilise its own prices using credit/debit allocated for that purpose. This is perfectly sound practice as long as the limits are respected. All communities are allowed to issue credit/debit and can use it equally for liquidity with other communities or for stabilising their own currency. In the case of fraud, damage would be limited only according to how much trust had been allocated to the rogue community, and would not be contagious.\nIn small scale systems the precise exchange rate matters much less. The largest community currency system has been running 15 years using exchange rates fixed a long time ago, and had no issues.\nThe question remains then, as explained above, how balance limits are decided between member exchanges. Greater balance limits mean greater risk, which is to say greater impact in case of failure to return to zero. Each group should decide its own process/formula through a political process. Limits should be imposed by a custom script or plugin in the accounting software and not set in stone. There are plenty of examples from which to take inspiration.\nIn the banking system it is normal to grant individuals overdrafts up to two months of salary without asking too many questions. Larger loans, for commerce and business startups, need to be scrutinised by the bank which has a mandate to be risk averse.\nEvery business barter network has its own formula or process for allocating credit, which usually takes into account the desirability of the applicants produce and their trading volume.\nWithin LETS, there are many theories about how balance limits should be determined. Typically a minimum limit is given to new members, which increases proportionately with volume of trade. \nBOX: In Western Austria 'talents' were flowing from a rural Tauschkreis to a nearby urban one and both systems on were stuck on their respective limits and in danger of freezing. They put their heads together and organised a rural festival and bussed in the city folk to spend their talents back and restore the balance.\n\n4.5    Experiences of previous federations\nThe credit commons may be a new formulation, but the federation of local currencies has been attempted many times since the emergence of LETS in the 1980s.\n4.5.1    Business barter\nThe business barter sector has many federations already because this is the business model of the software providers.\nTypically one software is sold to as many exchanges as possible and the vendor takes a dollar commission from each inter-exchange transactions, which seems inappropriate because no dollars change hands and also disincentivises exchange, more so if the fee is high.\nThis model of federation serves the software providers more than the traders because it carves up the marketplace, keeping traders separate according to their exchange’s software choice. In this way of thinking, members are property to be owned, before they are customers to be served!\nThis way also causes problems because the software providers assume that each exchanges barter dollars are worth the same without checking the integrity of the exchanges, which all to often are suffering from a profligate house account.\nThe International Reciprocal Trade Organisation sought to improve the situation by introducing another currency governed by itself, called Universal Currency. The system is its own platform and thus members have the experience of being in two exchanges and using two currencies. In 2014 the system ran into liquidity problems and fraud allegations followed. The system has now been rebooted in partnership with Bartercard, but it is not clear that the governance problems were addressed.\n4.5.2    LETS\nIn the 1990s there were several attempts to make accounting software for LETS using databases on local machines. The most valiant attempt at intertrading using Access was in Scotland where everyone was using a well developed MS Access application called SAM. The LETS of LETS was held in a separate instance of SAM and transactions were communicated by email.\nAround 2003 CES arrived, a web service allowing LETS to have their own web site in which members managed their own accounts rather than processing cheques communicating by post. CES grew quickly when it offered an intertrading mechanism between exchanges. A fixed exchange rate was calculated according to the national currency and the time-value of each exchanges unit, and this persists to this day.\nThe author of this document and CTO of Community Forge attempted to improve the CES system with an open API and in 2012 but the task was too onerous.\nSeveral LETS around Zurich are networked together with a semi automatic system which requires they all use the same platform.\n4.5.3    Timebanking\nTimebanking software has always been much more centralised than LETS being produced by the national associations rather than the communities themselves. Thus all the timebanking platforms, sharing a unit of account have enjoyed a high degree of interoperability.\nThe initial USA and UK systems were poorly built and managed and eventually both gave way to a free, well run, but closed source platform which now hosts several hundred timebanks. This means those timebanks are interoperable in theory but so far no policy exists to manage trading limits and no API to include software hosted elsewhere.\n\n\n\f\n5    Natural analogies\n5.1    A biomimicry perspective\nThis section was co-authored with Jamie Brown-Hansen.\nThe field of biomimicry is, among other things, a way of doing biology that looks for unifying patterns in the design of natural systems. There is enormous diversity in the natural world, yet biologists are able to identify certain design strategies that are common across multiple species and even kingdoms of species. Some of the deepest design patterns, in fact, can be recognised in almost all biological systems at every scale, from bacteria to multicellular organisms to entire ecosystems. These unifying patterns are referred to within the biomimicry community as Life’s Principles. They represent a design framework that has delivered thriving, regenerative systems in the natural world for 3.8 billion years, a proven recipe for long-term success within the operating conditions of this planet that we can apply where relevant in the effort to achieve sustainable human systems, including our systems of exchange.\nThe proposal of the credit commons is consistent with many of nature’s core unifying design patterns: it is bottom-up, locally attuned and adapted, diverse, decentralised, iterative, modular, and premised on quantitative stability over time. The interconnection of community-based mutual credit systems is also endorsed by the Bio-credits Working Group of the Biomimicry Global Network in answer to the question, “How would nature design a financial system?” The remainder of this section draws out some specific characteristics of the credit commons proposal that are consistent with natural system design.\n5.1.1 Locally attuned and adapted\nIn the natural world, chances of survival improve when organisms are well adapted and responsive to local conditions around them. Similarly, after decades of policy experimentation and experience, sustainable development strategists have learned that the most appropriate prescriptions for human development in any given region are attuned and adapted to local context. In the conventional bank credit system innovations in system design are templated first at the global level and make their way down to national level implementation thereafter, often without further adaptation to the contexts of individual communities.\nSome measures have shown strong correlations with good econometric outcomes across the board, such as investments in health, education and women. However, some experiences of standardised policy prescriptions applied to countries irrespective of local context have also been catastrophic. For example after the 2008 financial crisis, a committee in Basel required that banks to increase their capital requirements, which lead to a wave of debt-related suicides amongst farmers in India.\nThe credit commons starts with local innovation by communities themselves, attuned and adapted to their particular context and needs.\n5.1.2 Bottom-up development combining modular and nested components\nLiving systems assemble components one unit at a time, with development starting at the smallest scale. Simple solutions to a basic problem are nested within larger systems to form more complex entities. Starting with simple building blocks moving to more complex allows all the parts of the new system to grow and develop in response to local contexts, from the bottom up. This recalls the biological metaphor of cohabiting cells working together to form a multicellular organism. A cell is a (comparatively) simple entity and a life form in its own right. Biology gives us many examples of cells working together and specialising to make an organism with a higher degree of organisation.\nThe credit commons proposes that the economy be re-imagined from the bottom up in a self-organised manner analogous to the design process of the natural world. The power of the state to force citizens to accept its promises as money is anathema to notions of freedom of persons, and of markets. Considering the value of legal tender monies rests entirely on the productivity of the citizens, they are the natural candidates to issue promises for produce, if money be such. Systems in which a currency is imposed from the above lead to disparities in the availability of the currency, as we see in the Eurozone between Germany and Greece, for example. The biomimetic principle of designing from the bottom up would suggest every person, or more likely every economy, have its own currency for internal trade, and that complexity and scale be layered on top of that stable system.\n5.1.3    Embody resilience through systemic diversity and decentralisation \nClose to the principle of building from the bottom up is the principle of decentralisation. Many centres increases the resilience of the whole system, because it reduces dependences and single points of failure. Natural systems maintain function following disturbance by incorporating a variety of duplicate forms, processes, or systems that are not located exclusively together. \nThe Biomimicry Resource Handbook explains: “Resilience is the capacity of a system to maintain function following a disturbance. In short, it is the ability to recover after adversity. The capacity for resiliency, from bodily organs to ecosystems, often depends on the interconnectedness and functional diversity of multiple systems. When one system fails or does poorly, others can step in to compensate, either briefly or long term. As the nature of the disturbance is unpredictable, variation in strategies allows for some to endure while others may be lost. Redundancy permits the remaining to continue despite losing some, and decentralisation ensures that independent of where the disturbance falls, not all components will be subject to its impacts.”\nThe credit commons can be understood as a permaculture landscape of diverse local models interacting with each other, analogous to a natural ecosystem. A variety of locally attuned credit modules interacting in dynamic non-equilibrium is a more resilient structure than the metaphorical monoculture of today’s prevailing monetary system, according to former central banker, Bernard Lietaer.\n5.1.4    Protective membranes regulating in/out\nIn modern economies the balance of trade figure reveals how much value a country is gaining or losing. It is obtained by measuring the flow of the national currency across borders. It is very hard to obtain this figure for local or regional economies which use the same currency as their neighbours. With much more localised currencies, this figure can tell us a lot about microeconomic health and activity. Each member of a mutual credit network has a maximum extent to which its balance can deviate from zero. These limits function like a membrane of a cell, revealing the value going in and out to the wider system. In economic terms a balance-of-trade indicator is built in to each economy and the health and needs of each economy becomes visible. Limits can be set by local economy AND by the higher order system and the lowest limits respected. This affords local economies a level of protection against strong inflows or outflows of credit which would cause inflation/deflation and distort the value of their currency.\nAs the localities join together to form bioregions, and bioregions to form countries, transactions which have to pass between more balance limits, and more cultural barriers, become more cumbersome and probably more expensive. In this way the credit commons architecture favours localised exchange.\n5.1.5    Fractal design\nAs we have shown, clearing systems can be nested, with one clearing system having an account in a meta system. Smaller local modules are nested within larger regional modules, with the pattern repeated up to the global scale. This is consistent with the pattern of system design in the natural world from microorganism to biosphere. Moreover, not only are facilities in the credit commons modular and nested, they are also iterative. In other words, the same principles of organisation and engagement can be applied at each system level. This is analogous to patterns of fractal design in the nature world. \nFor example, in order for a mutual credit facility to function, all participants must agree to the principle of balanced mutual exchange. In other words, they agree to give and receive equally over the course of their membership in the credit community. Concretely, this can mean, for example, that participants must start with a balance of zero, and end with a balance of zero. This principle applies not just to individual participants in a local credit community, but also to local communities participating in a regional credit facility, and so on up to the global level. In the case of a regional facility, each local community agrees to balance its imports and exports in order to participate; the same principle applied at the next level.\n\nWe would suggest around 4 levels of nesting ranging from local systems to bioregional systems, to national or linguistic regions, to a world clearing system. This allows the same mechanism to serve at all scales of the economy and probably provides a bias towards more local trade, since currencies are more valuable nearer to where they can be spent. \n5.2    Money as flows in a field\nIt is tempting when exploring the True nature of money, as theologians study the bread in the Eucharist, to study the tokens and the exchanges. One popular approach is to posit a substance called 'value' which resides in the tokens, either intrinsically because the tokens are made of some valuable stuff (use value), or by government decree (exchange value). This is reminiscent of the theory of transubstantiation in which the bread somehow 'changes' into into the body of Christ.\nBut this whole approach assumes that money is some kind of stuff which moves from hand to hand. Even fiat money is a commodity insofar as it is valued for itself more than for what it can buy.\nWhen we look at the different ways of issuing money, we see clearly that 97% of modern money is NOT a commodity. It comes from nothing and exists only on bank balance sheets. This is accounting money, the kind used in mutual credit systems. And it has some other interesting properties:\nFor every unit of money created as a liability, there is a corresponding asset created with equal and opposite value\nThe money flows into circulation and at the appointed time some money - not necessarily the same money is pulled out of circulation and cancelled out against the asset, leaving nothing.\nWhen we look at cash we might imagine each piece moves around the economy independently of other money, like a ball bouncing randomly around a pinball machine. But with accounting money you can't mark the bills and track one piece of money just like you can't pinpoint an electron. A better analogy is a field.\nIt turns out that money is very like energy. By studying the substance we miss the wood for the trees. The paradox of money-as-a-commodity and money-as-a-promise is resolved once money is regarded as a circuit or as a wave acting in a field. It is created when no-value splits into assets and liabilities, just like when a neutral photon breaks into a positron and an electron which go spinning off in different directions and times. Money can be seen like electrons leaping from atom to atom, but look at the whole picture and money flows like a wave in a field, pushing waves before it and pulling waves behind it. What matters is not the atoms or the leaping, but the integrity and balance of the circuit. \nAt least, that's when it works.\nWhen we treat money as a commodity, the flows get out of sync. When we hoard money and relend the same money twice we prevent it from returning to source. When we just read the peaks and not the troughs, we miss the coming tsunami.\nWhen, for cultural reasons, borrowers take all the responsibility and risk, while lenders charge rent on their absent 'property' the two parties will never dance well together, leading to gluts and dearths and arhythmia.\nCredit money, or accounting money is very much like electricity, and the conceptual leap if we want master it is the same leap as from Newtonian mechanics to Quantum mechanics.\n\n\n\f\nConclusion\nThere are no reliable statistics, but since the financial system transitioned into the realm of fiction in 2008, the present author has witnessed a noticeable growth in complementary currency activities. The LETS have been declining since at least the turn of the century. Time banking has benefitted from institutional support and more favourable legal rulings, and there are several projects which fit neither family. I judge that the success rate of currency projects remains very low. This is because most complementary currencies are started by an isolated enthusiast, but they can only succeed when many people actively participate. Awareness that money itself may not be a neutral commodity is certainly growing, but that understanding is a long way from making a conscious decision to invest effort in the local economy, and to do so outside of legal tender money.\nIt will be argued therefore, that the very notion of a local economy is so eroded in a global society, and money itself so aspatial, and local money systems so lacklustre that there is nothing to federate.\nBut it can also be argued that a credit commons would strengthen all the local systems, giving them new uses and wider relevance. Local currencies would undoubtedly be more useful if they could be spent in other localities. In addition, the process of making local systems interoperable will increase awareness about how money systems could be run, and what is possible once we learn to cooperate.\nFinally, human architectures of exchange may be better positioned to serve as an organ of planetary ecology, fostering global conditions conducive to biological life, if their patterns of development are consistent with the bottom-up pattern of systems innovation in the natural world. The consistency of design principles can allow human and natural systems to flow more seamlessly together so that “the city can no longer be distinguished from the forest” from a systems design perspective. \nEnough open source software already exists (some created by the author of this document) for local communities to design and own local exchanges.

But the many benefits have not offset other concerns: price instability, the punitive legal judgements, fear-mongering in the financial press, and latterly serious governance issues. Having been designed as a sort of digital gold, Bitcoin suffers from many of the same flaws as gold-money. Any money-as-commodity is vulnerable to hoarding, speculation and throttling by the wealthiest players in the market."

In the first place, these institutions must promote local creativity and support community initiatives that are organized through solidarity, horizontal and equitable relationships. Second, they must encourage the greatest possible circulation of money at the local level. This means attracting locally generated surpluses and making them circulate as many times as possible within the local space, thus increasing the multiplier effect of a given level of deposits and savings. Third, these institutions must adjust themselves so that the savers, or the generators of surpluses, may decide on the use of their resources, thus allowing for a greater transparency in the relationship between saver and investor that may, in turn, promote greater participation in activities devoted to making development alternatives in the local space more viable. Fourth, these financial institutions must be managed in a cooperative way by people in the community itself, which means that the management should also be local in origin. Finally, if the local financial institution is to gain credibility, it must be protected against any potential liquidity crisis.\nWho among us even knows how to build a financial institution? Before that we need to re-learn how to trust and cooperate, how to give and receive, how to put down our own projects to move further, faster with others’. "

And in a very practical sense, if not in a legal one, we do own they money in our pockets. But most money is not in the form of cash but in the form of bank deposits, which is something else entirely. As with money, we need to know who has the right to create bank deposits, and who gives value to bank deposits, by what law banks are allowed to subtract them from our accounts, and how transaction charges can be so high 6 years since the invention of blockchains. Bank deposits behave much less like a commodity than money - it is created from nothing as a liability, it is always owned by the bank and can only move within a legally defined infrastructure. The balance in my account is merely the promise of the bank to give me cash if it is able, and if it wants to. The 97% of modern money which is bank deposits is privately owned in the sense that it is issued at the discretion of, at a price determined by, and for the profit of, private banking institutions.\nBut banks do not only store money and earn rent on credit issued ex nihilo. Banks also perform the other function of money which is making payments, and earn vast sums from doing so. Moving money is as simple as debiting one account and crediting another. We can see how this works in Western Union where cash is paid in office and paid out of another office in another country moments later. It is clear the actual money wasn’t transferred between franchise outlets, only the promise of it. All banking networks and within banks are working with these promises, of money, of gold, of other promises."

The notion of rails reminds Englishmen of the British Rail, a natural monopoly owned by the government which was privatised by ruling ideologues in the 1990s. There were price rises, safety concerns, large profits, and even now station staff can often find better prices than the computerised booking system. But I would point out that even in the midst of this farce, the rails were still managed by one company, Railtrack.\nI know of no Western government which owns its payment rails outside the postal service. This critical infrastructure is almost all owned by private corporations. This ‘natural’ cartel would have us believe that the only way to move ‘money’ is to own or rent the rails from payer to payee. Many small, specialist and startup payments companies with no rails of their own pay to piggy-back on the rails of one of these corporations because building another set of rails would be prohibitively expensive."

This raises difficult questions about governance, which became a serious problem when a fork, Bitcoin XT was proposed. Decisions in Bitcoin are taken democratically, not with one person/one vote, but one miner/one vote. The owners of the mining machines are not representative of all Bitcoin’s stakeholders. The major dilemma in the community is now whether to develop the system towards greater adoption by complying with regulation, or to continue in the legal grey areas but upholding libertarian ideals.\nThere is much confusion in the cryptocurrency discourse about the decentralisation of money and payments. All cryptocurrencies are built on a singleton ledger which is distributed across many machines. A single ledger is a point of centralisation, as is a single currency, even if there are many copies of the ledger in a distributed data architecture. Advocates of economic and financial decentralisation are very pleased to have witnessed the arrival of blockchain technologies, but cannot celebrate all the focus on a single currency with a single issuance policy (or algorithm) on a singleton ledger. Many have envisaged a multi-currency marketplace with cryptocurrencies freely competing, thus allowing for a deeper decentralisation, but progress in this direction is as slow as uptake of those alt-currencies, almost none of which have any basis for being valuable, (such as a commodity backing or legal pronouncement) nor could compete with Bitcoin in any meaningful way."

        "text": "A currency’s backing is very important to establish the legal status and also the value of a currency. If a currency can be priced unequivocally in dollars, transactions will be taxed at the dollar rate. This is entirely appropriate for a business which is doing barter as a way to get better prices of free liquidity but which otherwise measures its profit in dollars.\nIf there is no convertibility to dollars governments step beyond their philosophical remit (this is just my opinion; I’ve never heard a government attempt to justify its actions or its existence philosophically). Rather than tax the money changing hands, guidelines around LETS taxation indicate that professional work itself should be taxed, at the going rate. So I could unblock the sink of an old lady for LETS no problem, but a plumber would have to declare the work done and pay tax on the normal callout charge. It starts to get absurd. What if the plumber invoiced a nominal amount, or charged no LETS at all, or registered an unwritten favour?\nIs it legal to give my labour to a friend instead of selling it for money? Does government claim ownership of everything of value we produce? Does government determine the value everything using its own legal tender as a measure? Is any life or property possible without money being demanded from people under threat of force? This is a legal grey area that needs to be explored.\n3.2    Ledger money\nWe have seen above a kind of virtual money which exists on a ledger as the imbalance between accounts. There is no money, zero, in the ledger, but only account balances going up and down, their total always being zero.\nLedgers in banks and other corporations are used to store promises of real money, because it is easier to track and transport promises than cash. The intention is always to settle the balance at a later date with a single net payment; sometimes settlement is not even necessary if the net balance is close to zero. Sometimes these systems are said to provide liquidity because they allow payments without cash.\nA ledger used in this way, is called a credit clearing system. Before computers, all the cheques paid into the banks in one day would go to the clearing house where they would be added up and cancelled out. Banks would pay each other only the difference. Clearing means much the same even today: the hassle of moving actual money can be reduced insofar as transactions can be cleared beforehand, and this is precisely what ledgers do. And payment need never be made as long as accounts stay within a tolerable trustworthy distance of zero.\nConventional bank deposits are created on a balance sheet, thus as property, but on a ledger the payments between accounts are more like flows, or even relationships.\nLedger money is not minted or printed, it has no physical form and no fixed quantity. Starting from zero, Alice can pay Bob 10 units. Then Alice’s account is -10 and Bob’s +10. The total is zero. Bob can pay Carol, and Carol, Alice. When Alice’s balance is back to zero she can walk away, having paid and been paid without the hassle of shipping units back and forth in armoured vehicles.\nAnother way of looking at it is that spending and earning the internal currency units simultaneously creates and destroys ‘money’ such that, by definition there is always the right amount of it to represent the current credit/debit relationships.\nAlice’s having ‘owed’ the system for some time is not counted a debt and need not produce interest. In order for Bob to receive widgets before he paid widgets, someone else had to pay before they received. This is a reciprocal relationship and totally different from the commodity money paradigm in which the wealthy own all the money (or at least the right to promise what they don’t have) and rent it out to the poor. And let us not forget that what is really valuable here is not the money, but the goods and services flowing in the opposite direction!\nLedger money fulfils two of the three classical functions of money: the medium of exchange and the unit of account; but not the store of value function. Economists such as Silvio Gesell argued strongly that ‘money’ should not be intended as a long term store of value since the primary properties of money are its liquidity and virtuality. The store of value function should be performed by commodities or securitised commodities, and to expect money to perform all three functions is an error of thinking.\n3.3    Mutual credit economics\nUsing a ledger in this way, as a closed system with accounts extending credit to each other, is sometimes called mutual credit. This term focuses not so much on the clearing aspect, but on the fact that credit can be made available to anyone at any time, and the risk entailed by that credit is spread out across the whole system. In the event of an account being abandoned rather than being closed at zero, the whole system deviates from the perfect zero, and all members are affected equally when the total supply and total demand leave equilibrium.\nThis notion of economic equilibrium is a guiding principle of a mutual credit economy, and not of the global economy which is a competition to accumulate the most. Another word for economic equilibrium, is exchange, because parties give and receive in equal measure. When giving exactly equals receiving, the account balance is zero and only then may the account be closed. Since all accounts have agreed to close on zero, after Alice has paid Bob ten units, Alice is looking to earn 10 units and Bob is looking to spend ten units; thus supply equals demand. In a fiat or commodity money system, the governors, if they care, must use voodoo to calculate how much money to put into circulation for optimal trading without inflation, without bubbles, and without unemployment. In a mutual credit system this is a non-question. The political question then becomes, how much can people be trusted to deviate from zero and still return?\nThe further away a balance is from zero, the greater the risk that that account will fail to reciprocate. If no deviation were allowed there would be no liquidity and no trade. If infinite deviation was allowed, some players would only ever give and others only take. We observed earlier that supply always equals demand. Every force has an equal and opposite force. When accounts are hovering around their limits, struggling to reciprocate, that means there is equal and opposite pressure elsewhere in the system.\nA well-managed system will be able to mitigate these pressures by paying attention to those accounts and making it easier for them to trade back in the right direction.\nA poorly managed system may be lucky if negative failures to return to zero cancel out positive failures - defaults can be in either direction.\nOnce the design problem of how credit should be allocated is decided, perhaps by the people whose credit it is, which is everybody, then as much credit can be created as needed.\nAny system can of course have tweaks and redistributive mechanisms, but the fundamental properties are still important. Commodity money must be earned (or borrowed at interest) before it can be spent; the more of it you have, the better it is for you, though that might mean others are deprived. Those who have a scarce commodity (money), get more from renting it out. The day to day governance of such instruments is done through interest rate manipulation and taxing/spending, but the flagrant injustices of this paradigm are never fully mitigated by social security and other forms of redistribution.\nUsually some accounts have difficulty earning as much as they would like to spend and vice versa. Because these problems can affect the whole system, the whole system has an incentive to support those accounts, either by trading with them preferentially, redistributing credit or coming to some other arrangement. This mutual support is visible for what it is, not welfare bleeding out of the pay-packets of the people who actually work, but enabling everyone to both give and receive, which is essential for the health of the whole system.\nIt is well understood how spending locally can create a multiplier effect, and all local currencies seek to strengthen and make visible that virtuous circle. In that sense, a local currency can build solidarity within the local economy insofar as it actually diverts spending towards the local economy, which is a very difficult thing to measure.\nBut there is a deeper solidarity within a mutual credit system than within the multitude of Euro proxies which have sprung up in recent years. The value of the system depends on the engagement of the members and the quality of their experiences, which is the subject of the third paper in this series. The wealth gains that come from good governance, a glut of production and the wellbeing of the precarious members are spread around much more in a mutual credit system than in a commodity money system, where all the wealth gains are sent to the top of the pyramid as rents are adjusted.\nAll of which is why mutual credit is the money of the solidarity economy.\n3.4    Mutual credit in the real world\nAt the post WWII Bretton Woods conference, Keynes proposed that international trade be conducted through a country-to-country mutual credit system called the Bancor. The conference initially agreed the idea was sound and just, but then the USA unilaterally squashed the idea with a dollar/gold standard, then defaulted on their obligations and created the petrodollar system. Today few alternatives are discussed but the idea of going to back to the bancor has been mooted.\nThis is especially significant for an economy experiencing deflation - a scarcity of circulating money. The act of one account extending trust to another account to enable it to participate in a ‘split barter’ exchange can be seen as an act which creates liquidity. While ledgers are used throughout the financial world, there are much fewer examples of ledgers being used without the intention ever to settle, which is to say to settle debts through reciprocal exchange rather than money changing hands. \nThe most prominent is surely the business barter industry which helps businesses move unsold stock and get bums on otherwise empty seats, \nfollowed by the LETS movement which encourages the middle classes to meet each other and save money together. (French SEL, German Tauschkreis)\nfinally timebanking, in which poor and excluded people are given opportunities to support each other and build confidence. \nAt present a great many of these systems are poorly governed from a credit perspective and have a poor understanding of how mutual credit is supposed to work. Regulation within the business barter industry fails to prevent the owners of exchanges running up a deficit, which means buying all the best stuff and flooding the members with credit, and then never earning that credit back. Similar things happen in LETS and timebanks, but usually not for personal gain.\nThis has the effect that credit accumulates in members’ accounts and they want to spend, but the corresponding debit is not looking to earn. Thus the marketplace has more buyers than sellers and very often barter dollars change hands at less than parity with US dollars; inflation in these systems is a sure sign of poor governance. Bartercard national franchises do this routinely, I understand, but since their accounts are private, their innocence or guilt cannot be established.\nWhen the same things happens in LETS and timebanks, it matters much less because members depend less on these systems and are more forgiving. The governing board may decide to issue some credit to express the collective intention of the community, say to organise a festival, and the units may not be collected back in tax or entrance fees. The party account may stay negative forever and the corresponding units may slosh around creating a net positive balance in all the other accounts. Then someone might die with an equivalent positive balance and unwittingly the equilibrium is restored.\nI have heard members of business barter systems report that it didn’t work for them, never quite sure why it was so much easier to earn than spend the barter credit, members of LETS and Time banks almost always have positive experiences, often despite poor fiscal governance! The reason is because a mutual credit accounting system, accompanied by a directory of goods and services, exists to enable exchange and yields positive, productive relationships by the way. In contrast, the legal tender economy forces producers compete globally for every dollar or face poverty and shame languishing on the heap of the unemployed.\nMany members report feeling that this ledger money is easier to earn and less painful to give - it unlocks generosity.\n\n\f\n4    Federating local currencies\nThe credit commons is the notion, perhaps first voiced by Tom Greco, that local ledgers should be connected together using public infrastructure rails, with each currency retaining control of its own issuance and balance of trade, but governed cooperatively. I hope to explore the details below.\nThere have been a great many local exchange platforms created in the last few years but no sharing of code and certainly no interoperability between them. Teams who want to facilitate community exchange have given all their effort to building custom software and not enough to re-usable software and not enough to building community.\nSee the appendix for a condensed list of community exchange platforms none of which are interoperable and many of which have failed to thrive owing to lack of uptake. \nNote that while the credit commons itself is proposed to be a mutual credit system, any type of currency could participate. All that is required of a candidate member is an account for import/export and trust from existing members that the candidate will return to zero.\nThis section discusses some of the design parameters of a mutual credit federation.\n4.1    Legal Structure\nThere are pros and cons to using formal structures. For example managing a bank account in the name of an association is easier and more trusted than someone’s personal account. My vision of the credit commons is an informal association, accountable only to its members, which does not handle money at all. This is how Bitcoin works. There is no association but anyone can install some free software and just plug into the network. Later the Bitcoin Foundation was created to help grow Bitcoin but many users didn’t regard the foundation as legitimate.\nBy contrast the credit commons would embody a similar libertarian ethic, but instead of being an open system without trust, it would consist of private groups who may or may or not trust each other. Thus anyone could open an account in a credit commons, but only trusted people and groups could exchange. In this arrangement I see no benefit to registering the credit commons as an organisation, since no money should change hands and no legal recourse is needed between trusted parties.\n4.2    Governance\nThe most important governance question in a mutual credit system is to manage risk on behalf of all the members by determining the extent to which accounts can deviate from zero. Within a scarcity worldview, it is much more important to manage the negative limit both because members fear losing out and because there is more incentive to take without giving.\nSince the credit is mutually guaranteed by all member groups and by extension, all members of all member groups, it is critical that at least this part of the governing process be participative. The same principle applies in the legal tender economy, but there is no acknowledgement that it is workers who give value to money and risk management is done by banks only to maximise their profits and losses.\nAlso credit must be allocated as far as possible on a case-by-case basis. Banks are increasingly automating loan applications using algorithms, and while this is good for profits it does not serve entrepreneurs. The way to process credit applications more quickly is not through automation, but through the kind of aggregation we see in microcredit, where a loan request must be guaranteed by several people. In the credit commons a whole community would apply for credit from the collective of communities, and that community would guarantee that credit.\nThe governing process has other responsibilities, as in any community money system: managing relations and especially disputes between communities, monitoring communities who may be struggling with their balance of trade; recruiting new members, managing public perception.\nGovernance could be done by volunteers, or compensated volunteers. Any tax and any ‘wages’ could only be denominated in credit for goods and services.\nThere might be a centralised brokering service to stimulate trade, and that brokering might be paid for with taxes or transaction fees. Alternatively brokering could be done by private individuals who could earn commission, in credit.\n4.3    Nesting\nThe credit commons is an open infrastructure for community currency groups to make multilateral exchange agreements. Those groups are private and voluntary associations of individuals who may invite others to join them. Thus newcomers could not automatically join a private group but could form their own group. There could be many networks there which are not connected at all and there could be hierarchies of groups. For example all the time banks in UK could form a group to manage hours liquidity amongst themselves and Timebanks UK could be part of another group of all the national timebanking associations, also using the same unit of account, hours, which is the defining feature of timebanking.\nAt each level of organisation there would need to be a governing process comprising all its members.\nSimilarly the business barter networks could have their own arrangements in the same credit commons without touching timebanking, or as long as exchange rate mechanism is agreed, it could touch timebanking.\nThus payments from user to another might be registered at several levels depending how far in network space, the payment is going. A payment to a timebank in another country would have to obey the balance limits of both groups concerned at each level.\nThe concept of nesting credit clearing systems has also been discussed in the International Journal of Complementary Currency research\n4.4    Exchange rate mechanisms & balance limits\nThe impossible trinity applies equally to credit commons economies as to national economies:\nThe Impossible trinity (also known as the Trilemma) is a trilemma in international economics which states that it is impossible to have all three of the following at the same time:\nA stable foreign exchange rate\nFree capital movement (absence of capital controls)\nAn independent monetary policy. \nSince the credit commons is a tool for distributing political power and issuance of credit to the local level, independent monetary policy is not negotiable. A stable foreign exchange rate is maintained by curbing imports and exports, which is to say, balancing exports and imports. This gives every community an incentive to produce if wants to import and to spend if it wants to export. The designers of the Euro would have done well to apply such an ethic. Furthermore, speculation and price manipulation of currencies is contained according to the proportion of each community’s credit which is allowed to circulate outside its own accounts.\nThe post gold-standard FOREX system of currency exchange is a free market; this design has a self correcting mechanism which helps to keep prices stable. As the price of a currency deviates from its actual purchasing power, the price of goods and services in that country becomes distorted in a way that attracts trade in the opposite direction. For example, if a currency is undervalued, that country’s exports become cheaper, and demand for them increases, which drives up the currency price. This tendency towards stability is desirable in the credit commons.\nBut within that framework, it is possible for a community with a sovereign monetary policy, to stabilise its own prices using credit/debit allocated for that purpose. This is perfectly sound practice as long as the limits are respected. All communities are allowed to issue credit/debit and can use it equally for liquidity with other communities or for stabilising their own currency. In the case of fraud, damage would be limited only according to how much trust had been allocated to the rogue community, and would not be contagious.\nIn small scale systems the precise exchange rate matters much less. The largest community currency system has been running 15 years using exchange rates fixed a long time ago, and had no issues.\nThe question remains then, as explained above, how balance limits are decided between member exchanges. Greater balance limits mean greater risk, which is to say greater impact in case of failure to return to zero. Each group should decide its own process/formula through a political process. Limits should be imposed by a custom script or plugin in the accounting software and not set in stone. There are plenty of examples from which to take inspiration.\nIn the banking system it is normal to grant individuals overdrafts up to two months of salary without asking too many questions. Larger loans, for commerce and business startups, need to be scrutinised by the bank which has a mandate to be risk averse.\nEvery business barter network has its own formula or process for allocating credit, which usually takes into account the desirability of the applicants produce and their trading volume.\nWithin LETS, there are many theories about how balance limits should be determined. Typically a minimum limit is given to new members, which increases proportionately with volume of trade. \nBOX: In Western Austria 'talents' were flowing from a rural Tauschkreis to a nearby urban one and both systems on were stuck on their respective limits and in danger of freezing. They put their heads together and organised a rural festival and bussed in the city folk to spend their talents back and restore the balance.\n\n4.5    Experiences of previous federations\nThe credit commons may be a new formulation, but the federation of local currencies has been attempted many times since the emergence of LETS in the 1980s.\n4.5.1    Business barter\nThe business barter sector has many federations already because this is the business model of the software providers.\nTypically one software is sold to as many exchanges as possible and the vendor takes a dollar commission from each inter-exchange transactions, which seems inappropriate because no dollars change hands and also disincentivises exchange, more so if the fee is high.\nThis model of federation serves the software providers more than the traders because it carves up the marketplace, keeping traders separate according to their exchange’s software choice. In this way of thinking, members are property to be owned, before they are customers to be served!\nThis way also causes problems because the software providers assume that each exchanges barter dollars are worth the same without checking the integrity of the exchanges, which all to often are suffering from a profligate house account.\nThe International Reciprocal Trade Organisation sought to improve the situation by introducing another currency governed by itself, called Universal Currency. The system is its own platform and thus members have the experience of being in two exchanges and using two currencies. In 2014 the system ran into liquidity problems and fraud allegations followed. The system has now been rebooted in partnership with Bartercard, but it is not clear that the governance problems were addressed.\n4.5.2    LETS\nIn the 1990s there were several attempts to make accounting software for LETS using databases on local machines. The most valiant attempt at intertrading using Access was in Scotland where everyone was using a well developed MS Access application called SAM. The LETS of LETS was held in a separate instance of SAM and transactions were communicated by email.\nAround 2003 CES arrived, a web service allowing LETS to have their own web site in which members managed their own accounts rather than processing cheques communicating by post. CES grew quickly when it offered an intertrading mechanism between exchanges. A fixed exchange rate was calculated according to the national currency and the time-value of each exchanges unit, and this persists to this day.\nThe author of this document and CTO of Community Forge attempted to improve the CES system with an open API and in 2012 but the task was too onerous.\nSeveral LETS around Zurich are networked together with a semi automatic system which requires they all use the same platform.\n4.5.3    Timebanking\nTimebanking software has always been much more centralised than LETS being produced by the national associations rather than the communities themselves. Thus all the timebanking platforms, sharing a unit of account have enjoyed a high degree of interoperability.\nThe initial USA and UK systems were poorly built and managed and eventually both gave way to a free, well run, but closed source platform which now hosts several hundred timebanks. This means those timebanks are interoperable in theory but so far no policy exists to manage trading limits and no API to include software hosted elsewhere.\n\n\n\f\n5    Natural analogies\n5.1    A biomimicry perspective\nThis section was co-authored with Jamie Brown-Hansen.\nThe field of biomimicry is, among other things, a way of doing biology that looks for unifying patterns in the design of natural systems. There is enormous diversity in the natural world, yet biologists are able to identify certain design strategies that are common across multiple species and even kingdoms of species. Some of the deepest design patterns, in fact, can be recognised in almost all biological systems at every scale, from bacteria to multicellular organisms to entire ecosystems. These unifying patterns are referred to within the biomimicry community as Life’s Principles. They represent a design framework that has delivered thriving, regenerative systems in the natural world for 3.8 billion years, a proven recipe for long-term success within the operating conditions of this planet that we can apply where relevant in the effort to achieve sustainable human systems, including our systems of exchange.\nThe proposal of the credit commons is consistent with many of nature’s core unifying design patterns: it is bottom-up, locally attuned and adapted, diverse, decentralised, iterative, modular, and premised on quantitative stability over time. The interconnection of community-based mutual credit systems is also endorsed by the Bio-credits Working Group of the Biomimicry Global Network in answer to the question, “How would nature design a financial system?” The remainder of this section draws out some specific characteristics of the credit commons proposal that are consistent with natural system design.\n5.1.1 Locally attuned and adapted\nIn the natural world, chances of survival improve when organisms are well adapted and responsive to local conditions around them. Similarly, after decades of policy experimentation and experience, sustainable development strategists have learned that the most appropriate prescriptions for human development in any given region are attuned and adapted to local context. In the conventional bank credit system innovations in system design are templated first at the global level and make their way down to national level implementation thereafter, often without further adaptation to the contexts of individual communities.\nSome measures have shown strong correlations with good econometric outcomes across the board, such as investments in health, education and women. However, some experiences of standardised policy prescriptions applied to countries irrespective of local context have also been catastrophic. For example after the 2008 financial crisis, a committee in Basel required that banks to increase their capital requirements, which lead to a wave of debt-related suicides amongst farmers in India.\nThe credit commons starts with local innovation by communities themselves, attuned and adapted to their particular context and needs.\n5.1.2 Bottom-up development combining modular and nested components\nLiving systems assemble components one unit at a time, with development starting at the smallest scale. Simple solutions to a basic problem are nested within larger systems to form more complex entities. Starting with simple building blocks moving to more complex allows all the parts of the new system to grow and develop in response to local contexts, from the bottom up. This recalls the biological metaphor of cohabiting cells working together to form a multicellular organism. A cell is a (comparatively) simple entity and a life form in its own right. Biology gives us many examples of cells working together and specialising to make an organism with a higher degree of organisation.\nThe credit commons proposes that the economy be re-imagined from the bottom up in a self-organised manner analogous to the design process of the natural world. The power of the state to force citizens to accept its promises as money is anathema to notions of freedom of persons, and of markets. Considering the value of legal tender monies rests entirely on the productivity of the citizens, they are the natural candidates to issue promises for produce, if money be such. Systems in which a currency is imposed from the above lead to disparities in the availability of the currency, as we see in the Eurozone between Germany and Greece, for example. The biomimetic principle of designing from the bottom up would suggest every person, or more likely every economy, have its own currency for internal trade, and that complexity and scale be layered on top of that stable system.\n5.1.3    Embody resilience through systemic diversity and decentralisation \nClose to the principle of building from the bottom up is the principle of decentralisation. Many centres increases the resilience of the whole system, because it reduces dependences and single points of failure. Natural systems maintain function following disturbance by incorporating a variety of duplicate forms, processes, or systems that are not located exclusively together. \nThe Biomimicry Resource Handbook explains: “Resilience is the capacity of a system to maintain function following a disturbance. In short, it is the ability to recover after adversity. The capacity for resiliency, from bodily organs to ecosystems, often depends on the interconnectedness and functional diversity of multiple systems. When one system fails or does poorly, others can step in to compensate, either briefly or long term. As the nature of the disturbance is unpredictable, variation in strategies allows for some to endure while others may be lost. Redundancy permits the remaining to continue despite losing some, and decentralisation ensures that independent of where the disturbance falls, not all components will be subject to its impacts.”\nThe credit commons can be understood as a permaculture landscape of diverse local models interacting with each other, analogous to a natural ecosystem. A variety of locally attuned credit modules interacting in dynamic non-equilibrium is a more resilient structure than the metaphorical monoculture of today’s prevailing monetary system, according to former central banker, Bernard Lietaer.\n5.1.4    Protective membranes regulating in/out\nIn modern economies the balance of trade figure reveals how much value a country is gaining or losing. It is obtained by measuring the flow of the national currency across borders. It is very hard to obtain this figure for local or regional economies which use the same currency as their neighbours. With much more localised currencies, this figure can tell us a lot about microeconomic health and activity. Each member of a mutual credit network has a maximum extent to which its balance can deviate from zero. These limits function like a membrane of a cell, revealing the value going in and out to the wider system. In economic terms a balance-of-trade indicator is built in to each economy and the health and needs of each economy becomes visible. Limits can be set by local economy AND by the higher order system and the lowest limits respected. This affords local economies a level of protection against strong inflows or outflows of credit which would cause inflation/deflation and distort the value of their currency.\nAs the localities join together to form bioregions, and bioregions to form countries, transactions which have to pass between more balance limits, and more cultural barriers, become more cumbersome and probably more expensive. In this way the credit commons architecture favours localised exchange.\n5.1.5    Fractal design\nAs we have shown, clearing systems can be nested, with one clearing system having an account in a meta system. Smaller local modules are nested within larger regional modules, with the pattern repeated up to the global scale. This is consistent with the pattern of system design in the natural world from microorganism to biosphere. Moreover, not only are facilities in the credit commons modular and nested, they are also iterative. In other words, the same principles of organisation and engagement can be applied at each system level. This is analogous to patterns of fractal design in the nature world. \nFor example, in order for a mutual credit facility to function, all participants must agree to the principle of balanced mutual exchange. In other words, they agree to give and receive equally over the course of their membership in the credit community. Concretely, this can mean, for example, that participants must start with a balance of zero, and end with a balance of zero. This principle applies not just to individual participants in a local credit community, but also to local communities participating in a regional credit facility, and so on up to the global level. In the case of a regional facility, each local community agrees to balance its imports and exports in order to participate; the same principle applied at the next level.\n\nWe would suggest around 4 levels of nesting ranging from local systems to bioregional systems, to national or linguistic regions, to a world clearing system. This allows the same mechanism to serve at all scales of the economy and probably provides a bias towards more local trade, since currencies are more valuable nearer to where they can be spent. \n5.2    Money as flows in a field\nIt is tempting when exploring the True nature of money, as theologians study the bread in the Eucharist, to study the tokens and the exchanges. One popular approach is to posit a substance called 'value' which resides in the tokens, either intrinsically because the tokens are made of some valuable stuff (use value), or by government decree (exchange value). This is reminiscent of the theory of transubstantiation in which the bread somehow 'changes' into into the body of Christ.\nBut this whole approach assumes that money is some kind of stuff which moves from hand to hand. Even fiat money is a commodity insofar as it is valued for itself more than for what it can buy.\nWhen we look at the different ways of issuing money, we see clearly that 97% of modern money is NOT a commodity. It comes from nothing and exists only on bank balance sheets. This is accounting money, the kind used in mutual credit systems. And it has some other interesting properties:\nFor every unit of money created as a liability, there is a corresponding asset created with equal and opposite value\nThe money flows into circulation and at the appointed time some money - not necessarily the same money is pulled out of circulation and cancelled out against the asset, leaving nothing.\nWhen we look at cash we might imagine each piece moves around the economy independently of other money, like a ball bouncing randomly around a pinball machine. But with accounting money you can't mark the bills and track one piece of money just like you can't pinpoint an electron. A better analogy is a field.\nIt turns out that money is very like energy. By studying the substance we miss the wood for the trees. The paradox of money-as-a-commodity and money-as-a-promise is resolved once money is regarded as a circuit or as a wave acting in a field. It is created when no-value splits into assets and liabilities, just like when a neutral photon breaks into a positron and an electron which go spinning off in different directions and times. Money can be seen like electrons leaping from atom to atom, but look at the whole picture and money flows like a wave in a field, pushing waves before it and pulling waves behind it. What matters is not the atoms or the leaping, but the integrity and balance of the circuit. \nAt least, that's when it works.\nWhen we treat money as a commodity, the flows get out of sync. When we hoard money and relend the same money twice we prevent it from returning to source. When we just read the peaks and not the troughs, we miss the coming tsunami.\nWhen, for cultural reasons, borrowers take all the responsibility and risk, while lenders charge rent on their absent 'property' the two parties will never dance well together, leading to gluts and dearths and arhythmia.\nCredit money, or accounting money is very much like electricity, and the conceptual leap if we want master it is the same leap as from Newtonian mechanics to Quantum mechanics.\n\n\n\f\nConclusion\nThere are no reliable statistics, but since the financial system transitioned into the realm of fiction in 2008, the present author has witnessed a noticeable growth in complementary currency activities. The LETS have been declining since at least the turn of the century. Time banking has benefitted from institutional support and more favourable legal rulings, and there are several projects which fit neither family. I judge that the success rate of currency projects remains very low. This is because most complementary currencies are started by an isolated enthusiast, but they can only succeed when many people actively participate. Awareness that money itself may not be a neutral commodity is certainly growing, but that understanding is a long way from making a conscious decision to invest effort in the local economy, and to do so outside of legal tender money.\nIt will be argued therefore, that the very notion of a local economy is so eroded in a global society, and money itself so aspatial, and local money systems so lacklustre that there is nothing to federate.\nBut it can also be argued that a credit commons would strengthen all the local systems, giving them new uses and wider relevance. Local currencies would undoubtedly be more useful if they could be spent in other localities. In addition, the process of making local systems interoperable will increase awareness about how money systems could be run, and what is possible once we learn to cooperate.\nFinally, human architectures of exchange may be better positioned to serve as an organ of planetary ecology, fostering global conditions conducive to biological life, if their patterns of development are consistent with the bottom-up pattern of systems innovation in the natural world. The consistency of design principles can allow human and natural systems to flow more seamlessly together so that “the city can no longer be distinguished from the forest” from a systems design perspective. \nEnough open source software already exists (some created by the author of this document) for local communities to design and own local exchanges.

If a currency can be priced unequivocally in dollars, transactions will be taxed at the dollar rate. This is entirely appropriate for a business which is doing barter as a way to get better prices of free liquidity but which otherwise measures its profit in dollars.\nIf there is no convertibility to dollars governments step beyond their philosophical remit (this is just my opinion; I’ve never heard a government attempt to justify its actions or its existence philosophically). Rather than tax the money changing hands, guidelines around LETS taxation indicate that professional work itself should be taxed, at the going rate. So I could unblock the sink of an old lady for LETS no problem, but a plumber would have to declare the work done and pay tax on the normal callout charge. It starts to get absurd. What if the plumber invoiced a nominal amount, or charged no LETS at all, or registered an unwritten favour?\nIs it legal to give my labour to a friend instead of selling it for money? Does government claim ownership of everything of value we produce? Does government determine the value everything using its own legal tender as a measure? Is any life or property possible without money being demanded from people under threat of force? This is a legal grey area that needs to be explored."

        "text": "# 3.2    Ledger money\nWe have seen above a kind of virtual money which exists on a ledger as the imbalance between accounts. There is no money, zero, in the ledger, but only account balances going up and down, their total always being zero.\nLedgers in banks and other corporations are used to store promises of real money, because it is easier to track and transport promises than cash. The intention is always to settle the balance at a later date with a single net payment; sometimes settlement is not even necessary if the net balance is close to zero. Sometimes these systems are said to provide liquidity because they allow payments without cash.\nA ledger used in this way, is called a credit clearing system. Before computers, all the cheques paid into the banks in one day would go to the clearing house where they would be added up and cancelled out. Banks would pay each other only the difference. Clearing means much the same even today: the hassle of moving actual money can be reduced insofar as transactions can be cleared beforehand, and this is precisely what ledgers do. And payment need never be made as long as accounts stay within a tolerable trustworthy distance of zero.\nConventional bank deposits are created on a balance sheet, thus as property, but on a ledger the payments between accounts are more like flows, or even relationships.\nLedger money is not minted or printed, it has no physical form and no fixed quantity. Starting from zero, Alice can pay Bob 10 units. Then Alice’s account is -10 and Bob’s +10. The total is zero. Bob can pay Carol, and Carol, Alice. When Alice’s balance is back to zero she can walk away, having paid and been paid without the hassle of shipping units back and forth in armoured vehicles.\nAnother way of looking at it is that spending and earning the internal currency units simultaneously creates and destroys ‘money’ such that, by definition there is always the right amount of it to represent the current credit/debit relationships.\nAlice’s having ‘owed’ the system for some time is not counted a debt and need not produce interest. In order for Bob to receive widgets before he paid widgets, someone else had to pay before they received. This is a reciprocal relationship and totally different from the commodity money paradigm in which the wealthy own all the money (or at least the right to promise what they don’t have) and rent it out to the poor. And let us not forget that what is really valuable here is not the money, but the goods and services flowing in the opposite direction!\nLedger money fulfils two of the three classical functions of money: the medium of exchange and the unit of account; but not the store of value function. Economists such as Silvio Gesell argued strongly that ‘money’ should not be intended as a long term store of value since the primary properties of money are its liquidity and virtuality. The store of value function should be performed by commodities or securitised commodities, and to expect money to perform all three functions is an error of thinking.\n"

        "text": "# 3.3    Mutual credit economics\nUsing a ledger in this way, as a closed system with accounts extending credit to each other, is sometimes called mutual credit. This term focuses not so much on the clearing aspect, but on the fact that credit can be made available to anyone at any time, and the risk entailed by that credit is spread out across the whole system. In the event of an account being abandoned rather than being closed at zero, the whole system deviates from the perfect zero, and all members are affected equally when the total supply and total demand leave equilibrium.\nThis notion of economic equilibrium is a guiding principle of a mutual credit economy, and not of the global economy which is a competition to accumulate the most. Another word for economic equilibrium, is exchange, because parties give and receive in equal measure. When giving exactly equals receiving, the account balance is zero and only then may the account be closed. Since all accounts have agreed to close on zero, after Alice has paid Bob ten units, Alice is looking to earn 10 units and Bob is looking to spend ten units; thus supply equals demand. In a fiat or commodity money system, the governors, if they care, must use voodoo to calculate how much money to put into circulation for optimal trading without inflation, without bubbles, and without unemployment. In a mutual credit system this is a non-question. The political question then becomes, how much can people be trusted to deviate from zero and still return?\nThe further away a balance is from zero, the greater the risk that that account will fail to reciprocate. If no deviation were allowed there would be no liquidity and no trade. If infinite deviation was allowed, some players would only ever give and others only take. We observed earlier that supply always equals demand. Every force has an equal and opposite force. When accounts are hovering around their limits, struggling to reciprocate, that means there is equal and opposite pressure elsewhere in the system.\nA well-managed system will be able to mitigate these pressures by paying attention to those accounts and making it easier for them to trade back in the right direction.\nA poorly managed system may be lucky if negative failures to return to zero cancel out positive failures - defaults can be in either direction.\nOnce the design problem of how credit should be allocated is decided, perhaps by the people whose credit it is, which is everybody, then as much credit can be created as needed.\nAny system can of course have tweaks and redistributive mechanisms, but the fundamental properties are still important. Commodity money must be earned (or borrowed at interest) before it can be spent; the more of it you have, the better it is for you, though that might mean others are deprived. Those who have a scarce commodity (money), get more from renting it out. The day to day governance of such instruments is done through interest rate manipulation and taxing/spending, but the flagrant injustices of this paradigm are never fully mitigated by social security and other forms of redistribution.\nUsually some accounts have difficulty earning as much as they would like to spend and vice versa. Because these problems can affect the whole system, the whole system has an incentive to support those accounts, either by trading with them preferentially, redistributing credit or coming to some other arrangement. This mutual support is visible for what it is, not welfare bleeding out of the pay-packets of the people who actually work, but enabling everyone to both give and receive, which is essential for the health of the whole system.\nIt is well understood how spending locally can create a multiplier effect, and all local currencies seek to strengthen and make visible that virtuous circle. In that sense, a local currency can build solidarity within the local economy insofar as it actually diverts spending towards the local economy, which is a very difficult thing to measure.\nBut there is a deeper solidarity within a mutual credit system than within the multitude of Euro proxies which have sprung up in recent years. The value of the system depends on the engagement of the members and the quality of their experiences, which is the subject of the third paper in this series. The wealth gains that come from good governance, a glut of production and the wellbeing of the precarious members are spread around much more in a mutual credit system than in a commodity money system, where all the wealth gains are sent to the top of the pyramid as rents are adjusted.\nAll of which is why mutual credit is the money of the solidarity economy.\n"

I hope to explore the details below.\nThere have been a great many local exchange platforms created in the last few years but no sharing of code and certainly no interoperability between them. Teams who want to facilitate community exchange have given all their effort to building custom software and not enough to re-usable software and not enough to building community.\nSee the appendix for a condensed list of community exchange platforms none of which are interoperable and many of which have failed to thrive owing to lack of uptake. \nNote that while the credit commons itself is proposed to be a mutual credit system, any type of currency could participate. All that is required of a candidate member is an account for import/export and trust from existing members that the candidate will return to zero.\nThis section discusses some of the design parameters of a mutual credit federation.\n4.1    Legal Structure\nThere are pros and cons to using formal structures. For example managing a bank account in the name of an association is easier and more trusted than someone’s personal account. My vision of the credit commons is an informal association, accountable only to its members, which does not handle money at all. This is how Bitcoin works. There is no association but anyone can install some free software and just plug into the network. Later the Bitcoin Foundation was created to help grow Bitcoin but many users didn’t regard the foundation as legitimate.\nBy contrast the credit commons would embody a similar libertarian ethic, but instead of being an open system without trust, it would consist of private groups who may or may or not trust each other. Thus anyone could open an account in a credit commons, but only trusted people and groups could exchange. In this arrangement I see no benefit to registering the credit commons as an organisation, since no money should change hands and no legal recourse is needed between trusted parties.\n"

Within a scarcity worldview, it is much more important to manage the negative limit both because members fear losing out and because there is more incentive to take without giving.\nSince the credit is mutually guaranteed by all member groups and by extension, all members of all member groups, it is critical that at least this part of the governing process be participative. The same principle applies in the legal tender economy, but there is no acknowledgement that it is workers who give value to money and risk management is done by banks only to maximise their profits and losses.\nAlso credit must be allocated as far as possible on a case-by-case basis. Banks are increasingly automating loan applications using algorithms, and while this is good for profits it does not serve entrepreneurs. The way to process credit applications more quickly is not through automation, but through the kind of aggregation we see in microcredit, where a loan request must be guaranteed by several people. In the credit commons a whole community would apply for credit from the collective of communities, and that community would guarantee that credit.\nThe governing process has other responsibilities, as in any community money system: managing relations and especially disputes between communities, monitoring communities who may be struggling with their balance of trade; recruiting new members, managing public perception.\nGovernance could be done by volunteers, or compensated volunteers. Any tax and any ‘wages’ could only be denominated in credit for goods and services.\nThere might be a centralised brokering service to stimulate trade, and that brokering might be paid for with taxes or transaction fees. Alternatively brokering could be done by private individuals who could earn commission, in credit.\n"

Those groups are private and voluntary associations of individuals who may invite others to join them. Thus newcomers could not automatically join a private group but could form their own group. There could be many networks there which are not connected at all and there could be hierarchies of groups. For example all the time banks in UK could form a group to manage hours liquidity amongst themselves and Timebanks UK could be part of another group of all the national timebanking associations, also using the same unit of account, hours, which is the defining feature of timebanking.\nAt each level of organisation there would need to be a governing process comprising all its members.\nSimilarly the business barter networks could have their own arrangements in the same credit commons without touching timebanking, or as long as exchange rate mechanism is agreed, it could touch timebanking.\nThus payments from user to another might be registered at several levels depending how far in network space, the payment is going. A payment to a timebank in another country would have to obey the balance limits of both groups concerned at each level.\nThe concept of nesting credit clearing systems has also been discussed in the International Journal of Complementary Currency research\n"

A stable foreign exchange rate is maintained by curbing imports and exports, which is to say, balancing exports and imports. This gives every community an incentive to produce if wants to import and to spend if it wants to export. The designers of the Euro would have done well to apply such an ethic. Furthermore, speculation and price manipulation of currencies is contained according to the proportion of each community’s credit which is allowed to circulate outside its own accounts.\nThe post gold-standard FOREX system of currency exchange is a free market; this design has a self correcting mechanism which helps to keep prices stable. As the price of a currency deviates from its actual purchasing power, the price of goods and services in that country becomes distorted in a way that attracts trade in the opposite direction. For example, if a currency is undervalued, that country’s exports become cheaper, and demand for them increases, which drives up the currency price. This tendency towards stability is desirable in the credit commons.\nBut within that framework, it is possible for a community with a sovereign monetary policy, to stabilise its own prices using credit/debit allocated for that purpose. This is perfectly sound practice as long as the limits are respected. All communities are allowed to issue credit/debit and can use it equally for liquidity with other communities or for stabilising their own currency. In the case of fraud, damage would be limited only according to how much trust had been allocated to the rogue community, and would not be contagious.\nIn small scale systems the precise exchange rate matters much less. The largest community currency system has been running 15 years using exchange rates fixed a long time ago, and had no issues.\nThe question remains then, as explained above, how balance limits are decided between member exchanges. Greater balance limits mean greater risk, which is to say greater impact in case of failure to return to zero. Each group should decide its own process/formula through a political process. Limits should be imposed by a custom script or plugin in the accounting software and not set in stone. There are plenty of examples from which to take inspiration.\nIn the banking system it is normal to grant individuals overdrafts up to two months of salary without asking too many questions. Larger loans, for commerce and business startups, need to be scrutinised by the bank which has a mandate to be risk averse.\nEvery business barter network has its own formula or process for allocating credit, which usually takes into account the desirability of the applicants produce and their trading volume.\nWithin LETS, there are many theories about how balance limits should be determined. Typically a minimum limit is given to new members, which increases proportionately with volume of trade. \nBOX: In Western Austria 'talents' were flowing from a rural Tauschkreis to a nearby urban one and both systems on were stuck on their respective limits and in danger of freezing. They put their heads together and organised a rural festival and bussed in the city folk to spend their talents back and restore the balance.\n\n"

In this way of thinking, members are property to be owned, before they are customers to be served!\nThis way also causes problems because the software providers assume that each exchanges barter dollars are worth the same without checking the integrity of the exchanges, which all to often are suffering from a profligate house account.\nThe International Reciprocal Trade Organisation sought to improve the situation by introducing another currency governed by itself, called Universal Currency. The system is its own platform and thus members have the experience of being in two exchanges and using two currencies. In 2014 the system ran into liquidity problems and fraud allegations followed. The system has now been rebooted in partnership with Bartercard, but it is not clear that the governance problems were addressed.\n4.5.2    LETS\nIn the 1990s there were several attempts to make accounting software for LETS using databases on local machines. The most valiant attempt at intertrading using Access was in Scotland where everyone was using a well developed MS Access application called SAM. The LETS of LETS was held in a separate instance of SAM and transactions were communicated by email.\nAround 2003 CES arrived, a web service allowing LETS to have their own web site in which members managed their own accounts rather than processing cheques communicating by post. CES grew quickly when it offered an intertrading mechanism between exchanges. A fixed exchange rate was calculated according to the national currency and the time-value of each exchanges unit, and this persists to this day.\nThe author of this document and CTO of Community Forge attempted to improve the CES system with an open API and in 2012 but the task was too onerous.\nSeveral LETS around Zurich are networked together with a semi automatic system which requires they all use the same platform.\n4.5.3    Timebanking\nTimebanking software has always been much more centralised than LETS being produced by the national associations rather than the communities themselves. Thus all the timebanking platforms, sharing a unit of account have enjoyed a high degree of interoperability.\nThe initial USA and UK systems were poorly built and managed and eventually both gave way to a free, well run, but closed source platform which now hosts several hundred timebanks. This means those timebanks are interoperable in theory but so far no policy exists to manage trading limits and no API to include software hosted elsewhere.\n\n\n\f\n"

There is enormous diversity in the natural world, yet biologists are able to identify certain design strategies that are common across multiple species and even kingdoms of species. Some of the deepest design patterns, in fact, can be recognised in almost all biological systems at every scale, from bacteria to multicellular organisms to entire ecosystems. These unifying patterns are referred to within the biomimicry community as Life’s Principles. They represent a design framework that has delivered thriving, regenerative systems in the natural world for 3.8 billion years, a proven recipe for long-term success within the operating conditions of this planet that we can apply where relevant in the effort to achieve sustainable human systems, including our systems of exchange.\nThe proposal of the credit commons is consistent with many of nature’s core unifying design patterns: it is bottom-up, locally attuned and adapted, diverse, decentralised, iterative, modular, and premised on quantitative stability over time. The interconnection of community-based mutual credit systems is also endorsed by the Bio-credits Working Group of the Biomimicry Global Network in answer to the question, “How would nature design a financial system?” The remainder of this section draws out some specific characteristics of the credit commons proposal that are consistent with natural system design.\n5.1.1 Locally attuned and adapted\nIn the natural world, chances of survival improve when organisms are well adapted and responsive to local conditions around them. Similarly, after decades of policy experimentation and experience, sustainable development strategists have learned that the most appropriate prescriptions for human development in any given region are attuned and adapted to local context. In the conventional bank credit system innovations in system design are templated first at the global level and make their way down to national level implementation thereafter, often without further adaptation to the contexts of individual communities.\nSome measures have shown strong correlations with good econometric outcomes across the board, such as investments in health, education and women. However, some experiences of standardised policy prescriptions applied to countries irrespective of local context have also been catastrophic. For example after the 2008 financial crisis, a committee in Basel required that banks to increase their capital requirements, which lead to a wave of debt-related suicides amongst farmers in India.\nThe credit commons starts with local innovation by communities themselves, attuned and adapted to their particular context and needs.\n5.1.2 Bottom-up development combining modular and nested components\nLiving systems assemble components one unit at a time, with development starting at the smallest scale. Simple solutions to a basic problem are nested within larger systems to form more complex entities. Starting with simple building blocks moving to more complex allows all the parts of the new system to grow and develop in response to local contexts, from the bottom up. This recalls the biological metaphor of cohabiting cells working together to form a multicellular organism. A cell is a (comparatively) simple entity and a life form in its own right. Biology gives us many examples of cells working together and specialising to make an organism with a higher degree of organisation.\nThe credit commons proposes that the economy be re-imagined from the bottom up in a self-organised manner analogous to the design process of the natural world. The power of the state to force citizens to accept its promises as money is anathema to notions of freedom of persons, and of markets. Considering the value of legal tender monies rests entirely on the productivity of the citizens, they are the natural candidates to issue promises for produce, if money be such. Systems in which a currency is imposed from the above lead to disparities in the availability of the currency, as we see in the Eurozone between Germany and Greece, for example. The biomimetic principle of designing from the bottom up would suggest every person, or more likely every economy, have its own currency for internal trade, and that complexity and scale be layered on top of that stable system.\n5.1.3    Embody resilience through systemic diversity and decentralisation \nClose to the principle of building from the bottom up is the principle of decentralisation. Many centres increases the resilience of the whole system, because it reduces dependences and single points of failure. Natural systems maintain function following disturbance by incorporating a variety of duplicate forms, processes, or systems that are not located exclusively together. \nThe Biomimicry Resource Handbook explains: “Resilience is the capacity of a system to maintain function following a disturbance. In short, it is the ability to recover after adversity. The capacity for resiliency, from bodily organs to ecosystems, often depends on the interconnectedness and functional diversity of multiple systems. When one system fails or does poorly, others can step in to compensate, either briefly or long term. As the nature of the disturbance is unpredictable, variation in strategies allows for some to endure while others may be lost. Redundancy permits the remaining to continue despite losing some, and decentralisation ensures that independent of where the disturbance falls, not all components will be subject to its impacts.”\nThe credit commons can be understood as a permaculture landscape of diverse local models interacting with each other, analogous to a natural ecosystem. A variety of locally attuned credit modules interacting in dynamic non-equilibrium is a more resilient structure than the metaphorical monoculture of today’s prevailing monetary system, according to former central banker, Bernard Lietaer.\n5.1.4    Protective membranes regulating in/out\nIn modern economies the balance of trade figure reveals how much value a country is gaining or losing. It is obtained by measuring the flow of the national currency across borders. It is very hard to obtain this figure for local or regional economies which use the same currency as their neighbours. With much more localised currencies, this figure can tell us a lot about microeconomic health and activity. Each member of a mutual credit network has a maximum extent to which its balance can deviate from zero. These limits function like a membrane of a cell, revealing the value going in and out to the wider system. In economic terms a balance-of-trade indicator is built in to each economy and the health and needs of each economy becomes visible. Limits can be set by local economy AND by the higher order system and the lowest limits respected. This affords local economies a level of protection against strong inflows or outflows of credit which would cause inflation/deflation and distort the value of their currency.\nAs the localities join together to form bioregions, and bioregions to form countries, transactions which have to pass between more balance limits, and more cultural barriers, become more cumbersome and probably more expensive. In this way the credit commons architecture favours localised exchange.\n5.1.5    Fractal design\nAs we have shown, clearing systems can be nested, with one clearing system having an account in a meta system. Smaller local modules are nested within larger regional modules, with the pattern repeated up to the global scale. This is consistent with the pattern of system design in the natural world from microorganism to biosphere. Moreover, not only are facilities in the credit commons modular and nested, they are also iterative. In other words, the same principles of organisation and engagement can be applied at each system level. This is analogous to patterns of fractal design in the nature world. \nFor example, in order for a mutual credit facility to function, all participants must agree to the principle of balanced mutual exchange. In other words, they agree to give and receive equally over the course of their membership in the credit community. Concretely, this can mean, for example, that participants must start with a balance of zero, and end with a balance of zero. This principle applies not just to individual participants in a local credit community, but also to local communities participating in a regional credit facility, and so on up to the global level. In the case of a regional facility, each local community agrees to balance its imports and exports in order to participate; the same principle applied at the next level.\n\nWe would suggest around 4 levels of nesting ranging from local systems to bioregional systems, to national or linguistic regions, to a world clearing system. This allows the same mechanism to serve at all scales of the economy and probably provides a bias towards more local trade, since currencies are more valuable nearer to where they can be spent. \n5.2    Money as flows in a field\nIt is tempting when exploring the True nature of money, as theologians study the bread in the Eucharist, to study the tokens and the exchanges. One popular approach is to posit a substance called 'value' which resides in the tokens, either intrinsically because the tokens are made of some valuable stuff (use value), or by government decree (exchange value). This is reminiscent of the theory of transubstantiation in which the bread somehow 'changes' into into the body of Christ.\nBut this whole approach assumes that money is some kind of stuff which moves from hand to hand. Even fiat money is a commodity insofar as it is valued for itself more than for what it can buy.\nWhen we look at the different ways of issuing money, we see clearly that 97% of modern money is NOT a commodity. It comes from nothing and exists only on bank balance sheets. This is accounting money, the kind used in mutual credit systems. And it has some other interesting properties:\nFor every unit of money created as a liability, there is a corresponding asset created with equal and opposite value\nThe money flows into circulation and at the appointed time some money - not necessarily the same money is pulled out of circulation and cancelled out against the asset, leaving nothing.\nWhen we look at cash we might imagine each piece moves around the economy independently of other money, like a ball bouncing randomly around a pinball machine. But with accounting money you can't mark the bills and track one piece of money just like you can't pinpoint an electron. A better analogy is a field.\nIt turns out that money is very like energy. By studying the substance we miss the wood for the trees. The paradox of money-as-a-commodity and money-as-a-promise is resolved once money is regarded as a circuit or as a wave acting in a field. It is created when no-value splits into assets and liabilities, just like when a neutral photon breaks into a positron and an electron which go spinning off in different directions and times. Money can be seen like electrons leaping from atom to atom, but look at the whole picture and money flows like a wave in a field, pushing waves before it and pulling waves behind it. What matters is not the atoms or the leaping, but the integrity and balance of the circuit. \nAt least, that's when it works.\nWhen we treat money as a commodity, the flows get out of sync. When we hoard money and relend the same money twice we prevent it from returning to source. When we just read the peaks and not the troughs, we miss the coming tsunami.\nWhen, for cultural reasons, borrowers take all the responsibility and risk, while lenders charge rent on their absent 'property' the two parties will never dance well together, leading to gluts and dearths and arhythmia.\nCredit money, or accounting money is very much like electricity, and the conceptual leap if we want master it is the same leap as from Newtonian mechanics to Quantum mechanics.\n\n\n\f\n"

The LETS have been declining since at least the turn of the century. Time banking has benefitted from institutional support and more favourable legal rulings, and there are several projects which fit neither family. I judge that the success rate of currency projects remains very low. This is because most complementary currencies are started by an isolated enthusiast, but they can only succeed when many people actively participate. Awareness that money itself may not be a neutral commodity is certainly growing, but that understanding is a long way from making a conscious decision to invest effort in the local economy, and to do so outside of legal tender money.\nIt will be argued therefore, that the very notion of a local economy is so eroded in a global society, and money itself so aspatial, and local money systems so lacklustre that there is nothing to federate.\nBut it can also be argued that a credit commons would strengthen all the local systems, giving them new uses and wider relevance. Local currencies would undoubtedly be more useful if they could be spent in other localities. In addition, the process of making local systems interoperable will increase awareness about how money systems could be run, and what is possible once we learn to cooperate.\nFinally, human architectures of exchange may be better positioned to serve as an organ of planetary ecology, fostering global conditions conducive to biological life, if their patterns of development are consistent with the bottom-up pattern of systems innovation in the natural world. The consistency of design principles can allow human and natural systems to flow more seamlessly together so that “the city can no longer be distinguished from the forest” from a systems design perspective. \nEnough open source software already exists (some created by the author of this document) for local communities to design and own local exchanges.

        "text": "# 3.2    Ledger money\nWe have seen above a kind of virtual money which exists on a ledger as the imbalance between accounts. There is no money, zero, in the ledger, but only account balances going up and down, their total always being zero.\nLedgers in banks and other corporations are used to store promises of real money, because it is easier to track and transport promises than cash. The intention is always to settle the balance at a later date with a single net payment; sometimes settlement is not even necessary if the net balance is close to zero. Sometimes these systems are said to provide liquidity because they allow payments without cash.\nA ledger used in this way, is called a credit clearing system. Before computers, all the cheques paid into the banks in one day would go to the clearing house where they would be added up and cancelled out. Banks would pay each other only the difference. Clearing means much the same even today: the hassle of moving actual money can be reduced insofar as transactions can be cleared beforehand, and this is precisely what ledgers do. And payment need never be made as long as accounts stay within a tolerable trustworthy distance of zero.\nConventional bank deposits are created on a balance sheet, thus as property, but on a ledger the payments between accounts are more like flows, or even relationships.\nLedger money is not minted or printed, it has no physical form and no fixed quantity. Starting from zero, Alice can pay Bob 10 units. Then Alice’s account is -10 and Bob’s +10. The total is zero. Bob can pay Carol, and Carol, Alice. When Alice’s balance is back to zero she can walk away, having paid and been paid without the hassle of shipping units back and forth in armoured vehicles.\nAnother way of looking at it is that spending and earning the internal currency units simultaneously creates and destroys ‘money’ such that, by definition there is always the right amount of it to represent the current credit/debit relationships.\nAlice’s having ‘owed’ the system for some time is not counted a debt and need not produce interest. In order for Bob to receive widgets before he paid widgets, someone else had to pay before they received. This is a reciprocal relationship and totally different from the commodity money paradigm in which the wealthy own all the money (or at least the right to promise what they don’t have) and rent it out to the poor. And let us not forget that what is really valuable here is not the money, but the goods and services flowing in the opposite direction!\nLedger money fulfils two of the three classical functions of money: the medium of exchange and the unit of account; but not the store of value function. Economists such as Silvio Gesell argued strongly that ‘money’ should not be intended as a long term store of value since the primary properties of money are its liquidity and virtuality. The store of value function should be performed by commodities or securitised commodities, and to expect money to perform all three functions is an error of thinking.\n"

        "text": "# 4    Federating local currencies\nThe credit commons is the notion, perhaps first voiced by Tom Greco, that local ledgers should be connected together using public infrastructure rails, with each currency retaining control of its own issuance and balance of trade, but governed cooperatively. I hope to explore the details below.\nThere have been a great many local exchange platforms created in the last few years but no sharing of code and certainly no interoperability between them. Teams who want to facilitate community exchange have given all their effort to building custom software and not enough to re-usable software and not enough to building community.\nSee the appendix for a condensed list of community exchange platforms none of which are interoperable and many of which have failed to thrive owing to lack of uptake. \nNote that while the credit commons itself is proposed to be a mutual credit system, any type of currency could participate. All that is required of a candidate member is an account for import/export and trust from existing members that the candidate will return to zero.\nThis section discusses some of the design parameters of a mutual credit federation.\n4.1    Legal Structure\nThere are pros and cons to using formal structures. For example managing a bank account in the name of an association is easier and more trusted than someone’s personal account. My vision of the credit commons is an informal association, accountable only to its members, which does not handle money at all. This is how Bitcoin works. There is no association but anyone can install some free software and just plug into the network. Later the Bitcoin Foundation was created to help grow Bitcoin but many users didn’t regard the foundation as legitimate.\nBy contrast the credit commons would embody a similar libertarian ethic, but instead of being an open system without trust, it would consist of private groups who may or may or not trust each other. Thus anyone could open an account in a credit commons, but only trusted people and groups could exchange. In this arrangement I see no benefit to registering the credit commons as an organisation, since no money should change hands and no legal recourse is needed between trusted parties.\n"

        "text": "# 4.2    Governance\nThe most important governance question in a mutual credit system is to manage risk on behalf of all the members by determining the extent to which accounts can deviate from zero. Within a scarcity worldview, it is much more important to manage the negative limit both because members fear losing out and because there is more incentive to take without giving.\nSince the credit is mutually guaranteed by all member groups and by extension, all members of all member groups, it is critical that at least this part of the governing process be participative. The same principle applies in the legal tender economy, but there is no acknowledgement that it is workers who give value to money and risk management is done by banks only to maximise their profits and losses.\nAlso credit must be allocated as far as possible on a case-by-case basis. Banks are increasingly automating loan applications using algorithms, and while this is good for profits it does not serve entrepreneurs. The way to process credit applications more quickly is not through automation, but through the kind of aggregation we see in microcredit, where a loan request must be guaranteed by several people. In the credit commons a whole community would apply for credit from the collective of communities, and that community would guarantee that credit.\nThe governing process has other responsibilities, as in any community money system: managing relations and especially disputes between communities, monitoring communities who may be struggling with their balance of trade; recruiting new members, managing public perception.\nGovernance could be done by volunteers, or compensated volunteers. Any tax and any ‘wages’ could only be denominated in credit for goods and services.\nThere might be a centralised brokering service to stimulate trade, and that brokering might be paid for with taxes or transaction fees. Alternatively brokering could be done by private individuals who could earn commission, in credit.\n"

        "text": "# 4.4    Exchange rate mechanisms & balance limits\nThe impossible trinity applies equally to credit commons economies as to national economies:\nThe Impossible trinity (also known as the Trilemma) is a trilemma in international economics which states that it is impossible to have all three of the following at the same time:\nA stable foreign exchange rate\nFree capital movement (absence of capital controls)\nAn independent monetary policy. \nSince the credit commons is a tool for distributing political power and issuance of credit to the local level, independent monetary policy is not negotiable. A stable foreign exchange rate is maintained by curbing imports and exports, which is to say, balancing exports and imports. This gives every community an incentive to produce if wants to import and to spend if it wants to export. The designers of the Euro would have done well to apply such an ethic. Furthermore, speculation and price manipulation of currencies is contained according to the proportion of each community’s credit which is allowed to circulate outside its own accounts.\nThe post gold-standard FOREX system of currency exchange is a free market; this design has a self correcting mechanism which helps to keep prices stable. As the price of a currency deviates from its actual purchasing power, the price of goods and services in that country becomes distorted in a way that attracts trade in the opposite direction. For example, if a currency is undervalued, that country’s exports become cheaper, and demand for them increases, which drives up the currency price. This tendency towards stability is desirable in the credit commons.\nBut within that framework, it is possible for a community with a sovereign monetary policy, to stabilise its own prices using credit/debit allocated for that purpose. This is perfectly sound practice as long as the limits are respected. All communities are allowed to issue credit/debit and can use it equally for liquidity with other communities or for stabilising their own currency. In the case of fraud, damage would be limited only according to how much trust had been allocated to the rogue community, and would not be contagious.\nIn small scale systems the precise exchange rate matters much less. The largest community currency system has been running 15 years using exchange rates fixed a long time ago, and had no issues.\nThe question remains then, as explained above, how balance limits are decided between member exchanges. Greater balance limits mean greater risk, which is to say greater impact in case of failure to return to zero. Each group should decide its own process/formula through a political process. Limits should be imposed by a custom script or plugin in the accounting software and not set in stone. There are plenty of examples from which to take inspiration.\nIn the banking system it is normal to grant individuals overdrafts up to two months of salary without asking too many questions. Larger loans, for commerce and business startups, need to be scrutinised by the bank which has a mandate to be risk averse.\nEvery business barter network has its own formula or process for allocating credit, which usually takes into account the desirability of the applicants produce and their trading volume.\nWithin LETS, there are many theories about how balance limits should be determined. Typically a minimum limit is given to new members, which increases proportionately with volume of trade. \nBOX: In Western Austria 'talents' were flowing from a rural Tauschkreis to a nearby urban one and both systems on were stuck on their respective limits and in danger of freezing. They put their heads together and organised a rural festival and bussed in the city folk to spend their talents back and restore the balance.\n\n"

        "text": "# 4.5    Experiences of previous federations\nThe credit commons may be a new formulation, but the federation of local currencies has been attempted many times since the emergence of LETS in the 1980s.\n4.5.1    Business barter\nThe business barter sector has many federations already because this is the business model of the software providers.\nTypically one software is sold to as many exchanges as possible and the vendor takes a dollar commission from each inter-exchange transactions, which seems inappropriate because no dollars change hands and also disincentivises exchange, more so if the fee is high.\nThis model of federation serves the software providers more than the traders because it carves up the marketplace, keeping traders separate according to their exchange’s software choice. In this way of thinking, members are property to be owned, before they are customers to be served!\nThis way also causes problems because the software providers assume that each exchanges barter dollars are worth the same without checking the integrity of the exchanges, which all to often are suffering from a profligate house account.\nThe International Reciprocal Trade Organisation sought to improve the situation by introducing another currency governed by itself, called Universal Currency. The system is its own platform and thus members have the experience of being in two exchanges and using two currencies. In 2014 the system ran into liquidity problems and fraud allegations followed. The system has now been rebooted in partnership with Bartercard, but it is not clear that the governance problems were addressed.\n4.5.2    LETS\nIn the 1990s there were several attempts to make accounting software for LETS using databases on local machines. The most valiant attempt at intertrading using Access was in Scotland where everyone was using a well developed MS Access application called SAM. The LETS of LETS was held in a separate instance of SAM and transactions were communicated by email.\nAround 2003 CES arrived, a web service allowing LETS to have their own web site in which members managed their own accounts rather than processing cheques communicating by post. CES grew quickly when it offered an intertrading mechanism between exchanges. A fixed exchange rate was calculated according to the national currency and the time-value of each exchanges unit, and this persists to this day.\nThe author of this document and CTO of Community Forge attempted to improve the CES system with an open API and in 2012 but the task was too onerous.\nSeveral LETS around Zurich are networked together with a semi automatic system which requires they all use the same platform.\n4.5.3    Timebanking\nTimebanking software has always been much more centralised than LETS being produced by the national associations rather than the communities themselves. Thus all the timebanking platforms, sharing a unit of account have enjoyed a high degree of interoperability.\nThe initial USA and UK systems were poorly built and managed and eventually both gave way to a free, well run, but closed source platform which now hosts several hundred timebanks. This means those timebanks are interoperable in theory but so far no policy exists to manage trading limits and no API to include software hosted elsewhere.\n\n\n\f\n"

        "text": "# 5    Natural analogies\n5.1    A biomimicry perspective\nThis section was co-authored with Jamie Brown-Hansen.\nThe field of biomimicry is, among other things, a way of doing biology that looks for unifying patterns in the design of natural systems. There is enormous diversity in the natural world, yet biologists are able to identify certain design strategies that are common across multiple species and even kingdoms of species. Some of the deepest design patterns, in fact, can be recognised in almost all biological systems at every scale, from bacteria to multicellular organisms to entire ecosystems. These unifying patterns are referred to within the biomimicry community as Life’s Principles. They represent a design framework that has delivered thriving, regenerative systems in the natural world for 3.8 billion years, a proven recipe for long-term success within the operating conditions of this planet that we can apply where relevant in the effort to achieve sustainable human systems, including our systems of exchange.\nThe proposal of the credit commons is consistent with many of nature’s core unifying design patterns: it is bottom-up, locally attuned and adapted, diverse, decentralised, iterative, modular, and premised on quantitative stability over time. The interconnection of community-based mutual credit systems is also endorsed by the Bio-credits Working Group of the Biomimicry Global Network in answer to the question, “How would nature design a financial system?” The remainder of this section draws out some specific characteristics of the credit commons proposal that are consistent with natural system design.\n5.1.1 Locally attuned and adapted\nIn the natural world, chances of survival improve when organisms are well adapted and responsive to local conditions around them. Similarly, after decades of policy experimentation and experience, sustainable development strategists have learned that the most appropriate prescriptions for human development in any given region are attuned and adapted to local context. In the conventional bank credit system innovations in system design are templated first at the global level and make their way down to national level implementation thereafter, often without further adaptation to the contexts of individual communities.\nSome measures have shown strong correlations with good econometric outcomes across the board, such as investments in health, education and women. However, some experiences of standardised policy prescriptions applied to countries irrespective of local context have also been catastrophic. For example after the 2008 financial crisis, a committee in Basel required that banks to increase their capital requirements, which lead to a wave of debt-related suicides amongst farmers in India.\nThe credit commons starts with local innovation by communities themselves, attuned and adapted to their particular context and needs.\n5.1.2 Bottom-up development combining modular and nested components\nLiving systems assemble components one unit at a time, with development starting at the smallest scale. Simple solutions to a basic problem are nested within larger systems to form more complex entities. Starting with simple building blocks moving to more complex allows all the parts of the new system to grow and develop in response to local contexts, from the bottom up. This recalls the biological metaphor of cohabiting cells working together to form a multicellular organism. A cell is a (comparatively) simple entity and a life form in its own right. Biology gives us many examples of cells working together and specialising to make an organism with a higher degree of organisation.\nThe credit commons proposes that the economy be re-imagined from the bottom up in a self-organised manner analogous to the design process of the natural world. The power of the state to force citizens to accept its promises as money is anathema to notions of freedom of persons, and of markets. Considering the value of legal tender monies rests entirely on the productivity of the citizens, they are the natural candidates to issue promises for produce, if money be such. Systems in which a currency is imposed from the above lead to disparities in the availability of the currency, as we see in the Eurozone between Germany and Greece, for example. The biomimetic principle of designing from the bottom up would suggest every person, or more likely every economy, have its own currency for internal trade, and that complexity and scale be layered on top of that stable system.\n5.1.3    Embody resilience through systemic diversity and decentralisation \nClose to the principle of building from the bottom up is the principle of decentralisation. Many centres increases the resilience of the whole system, because it reduces dependences and single points of failure. Natural systems maintain function following disturbance by incorporating a variety of duplicate forms, processes, or systems that are not located exclusively together. \nThe Biomimicry Resource Handbook explains: “Resilience is the capacity of a system to maintain function following a disturbance. In short, it is the ability to recover after adversity. The capacity for resiliency, from bodily organs to ecosystems, often depends on the interconnectedness and functional diversity of multiple systems. When one system fails or does poorly, others can step in to compensate, either briefly or long term. As the nature of the disturbance is unpredictable, variation in strategies allows for some to endure while others may be lost. Redundancy permits the remaining to continue despite losing some, and decentralisation ensures that independent of where the disturbance falls, not all components will be subject to its impacts.”\nThe credit commons can be understood as a permaculture landscape of diverse local models interacting with each other, analogous to a natural ecosystem. A variety of locally attuned credit modules interacting in dynamic non-equilibrium is a more resilient structure than the metaphorical monoculture of today’s prevailing monetary system, according to former central banker, Bernard Lietaer.\n5.1.4    Protective membranes regulating in/out\nIn modern economies the balance of trade figure reveals how much value a country is gaining or losing. It is obtained by measuring the flow of the national currency across borders. It is very hard to obtain this figure for local or regional economies which use the same currency as their neighbours. With much more localised currencies, this figure can tell us a lot about microeconomic health and activity. Each member of a mutual credit network has a maximum extent to which its balance can deviate from zero. These limits function like a membrane of a cell, revealing the value going in and out to the wider system. In economic terms a balance-of-trade indicator is built in to each economy and the health and needs of each economy becomes visible. Limits can be set by local economy AND by the higher order system and the lowest limits respected. This affords local economies a level of protection against strong inflows or outflows of credit which would cause inflation/deflation and distort the value of their currency.\nAs the localities join together to form bioregions, and bioregions to form countries, transactions which have to pass between more balance limits, and more cultural barriers, become more cumbersome and probably more expensive. In this way the credit commons architecture favours localised exchange.\n5.1.5    Fractal design\nAs we have shown, clearing systems can be nested, with one clearing system having an account in a meta system. Smaller local modules are nested within larger regional modules, with the pattern repeated up to the global scale. This is consistent with the pattern of system design in the natural world from microorganism to biosphere. Moreover, not only are facilities in the credit commons modular and nested, they are also iterative. In other words, the same principles of organisation and engagement can be applied at each system level. This is analogous to patterns of fractal design in the nature world. \nFor example, in order for a mutual credit facility to function, all participants must agree to the principle of balanced mutual exchange. In other words, they agree to give and receive equally over the course of their membership in the credit community. Concretely, this can mean, for example, that participants must start with a balance of zero, and end with a balance of zero. This principle applies not just to individual participants in a local credit community, but also to local communities participating in a regional credit facility, and so on up to the global level. In the case of a regional facility, each local community agrees to balance its imports and exports in order to participate; the same principle applied at the next level.\n\nWe would suggest around 4 levels of nesting ranging from local systems to bioregional systems, to national or linguistic regions, to a world clearing system. This allows the same mechanism to serve at all scales of the economy and probably provides a bias towards more local trade, since currencies are more valuable nearer to where they can be spent. \n5.2    Money as flows in a field\nIt is tempting when exploring the True nature of money, as theologians study the bread in the Eucharist, to study the tokens and the exchanges. One popular approach is to posit a substance called 'value' which resides in the tokens, either intrinsically because the tokens are made of some valuable stuff (use value), or by government decree (exchange value). This is reminiscent of the theory of transubstantiation in which the bread somehow 'changes' into into the body of Christ.\nBut this whole approach assumes that money is some kind of stuff which moves from hand to hand. Even fiat money is a commodity insofar as it is valued for itself more than for what it can buy.\nWhen we look at the different ways of issuing money, we see clearly that 97% of modern money is NOT a commodity. It comes from nothing and exists only on bank balance sheets. This is accounting money, the kind used in mutual credit systems. And it has some other interesting properties:\nFor every unit of money created as a liability, there is a corresponding asset created with equal and opposite value\nThe money flows into circulation and at the appointed time some money - not necessarily the same money is pulled out of circulation and cancelled out against the asset, leaving nothing.\nWhen we look at cash we might imagine each piece moves around the economy independently of other money, like a ball bouncing randomly around a pinball machine. But with accounting money you can't mark the bills and track one piece of money just like you can't pinpoint an electron. A better analogy is a field.\nIt turns out that money is very like energy. By studying the substance we miss the wood for the trees. The paradox of money-as-a-commodity and money-as-a-promise is resolved once money is regarded as a circuit or as a wave acting in a field. It is created when no-value splits into assets and liabilities, just like when a neutral photon breaks into a positron and an electron which go spinning off in different directions and times. Money can be seen like electrons leaping from atom to atom, but look at the whole picture and money flows like a wave in a field, pushing waves before it and pulling waves behind it. What matters is not the atoms or the leaping, but the integrity and balance of the circuit. \nAt least, that's when it works.\nWhen we treat money as a commodity, the flows get out of sync. When we hoard money and relend the same money twice we prevent it from returning to source. When we just read the peaks and not the troughs, we miss the coming tsunami.\nWhen, for cultural reasons, borrowers take all the responsibility and risk, while lenders charge rent on their absent 'property' the two parties will never dance well together, leading to gluts and dearths and arhythmia.\nCredit money, or accounting money is very much like electricity, and the conceptual leap if we want master it is the same leap as from Newtonian mechanics to Quantum mechanics.\n\n\n\f\n"

        "text": "# Conclusion\nThere are no reliable statistics, but since the financial system transitioned into the realm of fiction in 2008, the present author has witnessed a noticeable growth in complementary currency activities. The LETS have been declining since at least the turn of the century. Time banking has benefitted from institutional support and more favourable legal rulings, and there are several projects which fit neither family. I judge that the success rate of currency projects remains very low. This is because most complementary currencies are started by an isolated enthusiast, but they can only succeed when many people actively participate. Awareness that money itself may not be a neutral commodity is certainly growing, but that understanding is a long way from making a conscious decision to invest effort in the local economy, and to do so outside of legal tender money.\nIt will be argued therefore, that the very notion of a local economy is so eroded in a global society, and money itself so aspatial, and local money systems so lacklustre that there is nothing to federate.\nBut it can also be argued that a credit commons would strengthen all the local systems, giving them new uses and wider relevance. Local currencies would undoubtedly be more useful if they could be spent in other localities. In addition, the process of making local systems interoperable will increase awareness about how money systems could be run, and what is possible once we learn to cooperate.\nFinally, human architectures of exchange may be better positioned to serve as an organ of planetary ecology, fostering global conditions conducive to biological life, if their patterns of development are consistent with the bottom-up pattern of systems innovation in the natural world. The consistency of design principles can allow human and natural systems to flow more seamlessly together so that “the city can no longer be distinguished from the forest” from a systems design perspective. \nEnough open source software already exists (some created by the author of this document) for local communities to design and own local exchanges.
