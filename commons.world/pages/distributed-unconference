People attending the conference must register, and be encouraged to sign up to some form of chat platform – preferably Twitter. This enabels interaction with remote audiences, and groups to form and continue to discuss ideas long after the conference has finished. It also enables\nTalks and video provocations\n\nDiscussions are often facilitated / provoked by short documentary style videos of the topic to be discussed. These short talks may be live at certain locations and then transferred asynchronously (see below) to other locations to be viewed as a projection. Alternatively video provocations can be prepared in advance in order to stimulate discussion.\nMultiple self assembled breakout discussions\n\nAnyone can propose a talk in an unconference. At the beginning of the event, the format is introduced to everyone, and if you are motivated to speak you step forwards and outline the nature of the question or topic you want to be discussed. Placing a summary of that topic on a shared board, an overview of the range of topics is then gathered in one place on a central board.\n\nAttendees of the conference then place a dot against the talks they are interested in attending, and through this feedback speakers are encouraged to pool topics, with unpopular topics combining with other speakers to fill a space, or overly popular topics splitting into distinct events. In this way the talks self assemble and agree a place and a time to take place. This all happens in a natural manual style with post-it notes, but there is no reason why we cannot look to augmenting this with mobile technology to take advantage of the distributed nature of events.\nVideo summaries of each group discussion\n\nA breakout group (see above) discusses the topic under consideration, and appoints a speaker to report back to the general group later in the evening. This is typically done live, in the central meeting space. In the distributed unconference format we are developing, these feedback reports are filmed using a mobile phone as a short “video summary” and when captured are sent over the internet to the central conference archive, from where they may be forwarded to other groups where they can act as “provocations”.\nAsynchronous distribution of video summaries\n\nWhile it is possible to live stream this material, the emphasis here is on editorial, and off-line working. Groups are free to discuss and deliberate without being recorded, and summaries of their discussion are then transmitted to other locations where they can be built upon, criticised, or otherwise replied to. This transmission can be asynchronous, allowing groups in different time zones to work together, or locations with poor or non-existent internet connection to take part, and the conference can also be spread over several days of even weekends.\nA live mix, a live stream\n\nAll these breakout groups, and video summaries from other locations and venues, come into a central studio, where a live broadcast can be presented mixing in preprogrammed content and questions coming from an online audience via Twitter or other social media. This live internet TV show is in part an entirely separate view of the conference, but can be integrated into the event in the form of a coming together in a single space, in which the video clips are presented mixed with live presentations to the whole local group.\n\nThe live mixes, can be augmented creatively with physical and virtual sets. Tables, furniture and studio sets can be created that embed blue screens video projection and objects that illustrate the nature of the talks and topics under discussion. Models can be constructed specifically to allow dolly like camera movements, and to enable styled camera shots or the participants to the conversation. Similarly virtual sets can be created in software and used to broadcast the talks. In this way it is possible to construct a highly stylised world in which the viewer is taken through real, and virtual spaces that have been constructed to transition between one physical space or discussion topic and another. These are low cost sets, and software that is free and simple to create.\nMultiple documentary remixes\n\nAll these conversations and the video provocations used to seed them are archived and released under a Creative commons license, allowing them to be remixed in any number of ways. This format is designed to allow not only multiple perspectives of the material presented, but also to encourage further and ongoing discussion and debate.\nA Global Show\n\nThis format is inherently global. It is designed from the outset to allow discussions to take place on a global scale involving film and video. It is a creative format, empowering set designers and producers to develop low cost innovative productions. It is a unique opportunity to experiments and explore new interactive formats.\n"

        "text": "\nRegistration\n\nRegistration is more important than usual, not for the usual reason of ticketing and building up a marketing list, but in order to facilitate group discussion, and ongoing interaction after the actual conference.  People attending the conference must register, and be encouraged to sign up to some form of chat platform – preferably Twitter. This enabels interaction with remote audiences, and groups to form and continue to discuss ideas long after the conference has finished. It also enables\nTalks and video provocations\n\nDiscussions are often facilitated / provoked by short documentary style videos of the topic to be discussed. These short talks may be live at certain locations and then transferred asynchronously (see below) to other locations to be viewed as a projection. Alternatively video provocations can be prepared in advance in order to stimulate discussion.\nMultiple self assembled breakout discussions\n\nAnyone can propose a talk in an unconference. At the beginning of the event, the format is introduced to everyone, and if you are motivated to speak you step forwards and outline the nature of the question or topic you want to be discussed. Placing a summary of that topic on a shared board, an overview of the range of topics is then gathered in one place on a central board.\n\nAttendees of the conference then place a dot against the talks they are interested in attending, and through this feedback speakers are encouraged to pool topics, with unpopular topics combining with other speakers to fill a space, or overly popular topics splitting into distinct events. In this way the talks self assemble and agree a place and a time to take place. This all happens in a natural manual style with post-it notes, but there is no reason why we cannot look to augmenting this with mobile technology to take advantage of the distributed nature of events.\nVideo summaries of each group discussion\n\nA breakout group (see above) discusses the topic under consideration, and appoints a speaker to report back to the general group later in the evening. This is typically done live, in the central meeting space. In the distributed unconference format we are developing, these feedback reports are filmed using a mobile phone as a short “video summary” and when captured are sent over the internet to the central conference archive, from where they may be forwarded to other groups where they can act as “provocations”.\nAsynchronous distribution of video summaries\n\nWhile it is possible to live stream this material, the emphasis here is on editorial, and off-line working. Groups are free to discuss and deliberate without being recorded, and summaries of their discussion are then transmitted to other locations where they can be built upon, criticised, or otherwise replied to. This transmission can be asynchronous, allowing groups in different time zones to work together, or locations with poor or non-existent internet connection to take part, and the conference can also be spread over several days of even weekends.\nA live mix, a live stream\n\nAll these breakout groups, and video summaries from other locations and venues, come into a central studio, where a live broadcast can be presented mixing in preprogrammed content and questions coming from an online audience via Twitter or other social media. This live internet TV show is in part an entirely separate view of the conference, but can be integrated into the event in the form of a coming together in a single space, in which the video clips are presented mixed with live presentations to the whole local group.\n\nThe live mixes, can be augmented creatively with physical and virtual sets. Tables, furniture and studio sets can be created that embed blue screens video projection and objects that illustrate the nature of the talks and topics under discussion. Models can be constructed specifically to allow dolly like camera movements, and to enable styled camera shots or the participants to the conversation. Similarly virtual sets can be created in software and used to broadcast the talks. In this way it is possible to construct a highly stylised world in which the viewer is taken through real, and virtual spaces that have been constructed to transition between one physical space or discussion topic and another. These are low cost sets, and software that is free and simple to create.\nMultiple documentary remixes\n\nAll these conversations and the video provocations used to seed them are archived and released under a Creative commons license, allowing them to be remixed in any number of ways. This format is designed to allow not only multiple perspectives of the material presented, but also to encourage further and ongoing discussion and debate.\nA Global Show\n\nThis format is inherently global. It is designed from the outset to allow discussions to take place on a global scale involving film and video. It is a creative format, empowering set designers and producers to develop low cost innovative productions. It is a unique opportunity to experiments and explore new interactive formats.\n"
