Using infrastructures and platforms needs to be non-discrimintary as in [[net-neutrality]] --> [[Infrastructure-Neutrality]] OR: [[Create non-discriminatory infrastructures]] \n- [[Openness]] is not to be conflated with [[Limitedness]]. You can openly invite people to a meeting without tying it to conditions (of age, race, gender, material wealth or whatever), but the full capacity of your meeting room might still be limited. Whenever you reach your limit. Try to fork. This is also possible in the material world, as commons tend not to compete with each other. An example: \"The more [[CSA]] the better.\" A food cooperation would not think the same way --> [[Be Open but Fork]]\n-  Whenever you coupled giving and taking you tend to move away from concrete contexts, needs, circumstances and above all from solutions that benefit potentially all. Wherever life unfolds, giving is unconditionned. Therefor... -> [[Decouple Giving&Taking]] see for instance [[care]], [[UBI]], [[CSA]]s etc\n- Produce locally what's heavy and share globally what's light [https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/the-ten-commandments-of-peer-production-and-commons-economics/2015/10/24 html] --> FORMULATE A PRINCIPLE\n\nDISCUSS: I don't know where we talk about ownership and institutional rules. I guess we should at some point simply integrate the Ostrom Design principles, to address the level of \"institutional design\" --> we will build on it anyway when it comes to state functions or \"none-state-functions\" ",
