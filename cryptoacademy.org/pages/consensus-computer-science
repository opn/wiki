      "text": "A fundamental problem in distributed computing and multi-agent systems is to achieve overall system reliability in the presence of a number of faulty processes. This often requires processes to agree on some data value that is needed during computation. Examples of applications of consensus include whether to commit a transaction to a database, agreeing on the identity of a leader, state machine replication, and atomic broadcasts. The real world applications include clock synchronization, PageRank, opinion formation, power smart grids, state estimation, control of UAVs, load balancing and so on - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science) wikipedia]"
