Media coverage has thus far focused mostly on the rating of individual citizens (which falls under \"societal integrity\"). However, the Chinese government‘s plans go beyond that and also include plans for credit scores for all businesses operating in China."

There are, however, multiple pilots testing the system on a local level as well as in specific sectors of industry. One such program has been implemented in Shanghai through its Honest Shanghai app, which uses facial recognition software to browse government records, and rates users accordingly. Some reports have stated that the ratings may use information gathered from Chinese citizens' online behavior,. Existing scoring systems run by private companies using such data (such as Sesame Credit) are still in an experimental phase."

      "text": "The Chinese government wants the basic structures of the Social Credit System to be in place by 2020. It is unclear whether the system will work as envisioned by then, but the Chinese government has fast-tracked the implementation of the Social Credit System, resulting in the publication of numerous policy documents and plans since the main plan was issued in 2014. If the Social Credit System is implemented as envisioned, it will constitute a new way of controlling both the behavior of individuals and of businesses."

      "text": "As of July 2017, no comprehensive, nation-wide social credit system exists, and very little firm information is available about how this system might work in practice. There are, however, multiple pilots testing the system on a local level as well as in specific sectors of industry. One such program has been implemented in Shanghai through its Honest Shanghai app, which uses facial recognition software to browse government records, and rates users accordingly. Some reports have stated that the ratings may use information gathered from Chinese citizens' online behavior,. Existing scoring systems run by private companies using such data (such as Sesame Credit) are still in an experimental phase."
