We’ve added a new grid tier to better target mobile devices and completely overhauled our semantic mixins.\n- Opt-in flexbox support is here.\n- Dropped wells, thumbnails, and panels for cards. Cards are a brand new component to Bootstrap, but they’ll feel super familiar as they do nearly everything wells, thumbnails, and panels did, only better.\n- Consolidated all our HTML resets into a new module, Reboot.\n- Brand new customization options. Instead of relegating style embellishments like gradients, transitions, shadows, and more to a separate stylesheet like v3, we’ve moved all those options into Sass variables. Want default transitions on everything or to disable rounded corners? Simply update a variable and recompile.\n- Dropped IE8 support and moved to rem and em units.\n- Rewrote all our JavaScript plugins. Every plugin has been rewritten in ES6 to take advantage of the newest JavaScript enhancements\n- Improved auto-placement of tooltips and popovers thanks to the help of a library called Tether.\nImproved documentation. We rewrote it all in Markdown and added a few handy plugins to streamline examples and code snippets to make working with our docs way easier. Improved search is also on it’s way.\nAnd tons more! Custom form controls, margin and padding classes, new utility classes, and more have also been included."
