I have been maintaining the pages of [[Changes In Month]] for a number of years now and always record the number of pages at the end of each month. I keep a note of the numbers on a spreadsheet. I have done some calculations on that and it gives a growth in pages running at a current annual rate of about 600, or about 1.7% (end of 2013). Some of that is the admin pages I create to monitor each month, say about 25 per year in total. The trend of this is upward from a low point of about half those figures at the end of 2011. In terms of what is actually going on, there are a small number of active discussions which can be located either from [[Recent Changes]] or by looking on [[Implicit Topics]] and going to one of the month pages, which will give a list of the topics active in that month.</i> -- [[John Fletcher]]",
