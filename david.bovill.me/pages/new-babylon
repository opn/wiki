      "text": "The Proposal \n(First Draft)\n\n“What we loose in geographical space we must recover in the form of psychological space”\n\n\nProject Objective\nTo create a unified (urban) space through a combination of site specific works utilising ephemeral structures, and achieving a coherent permanence through the creation of a new form of virtual architecture. \n\nThis space can be conceived of, and should be experienced as, a single city. The function of this space is to create environments in which a rich variety of creative social interactions can take place. This is not a space to “view” a performance, but a space in which you inhabit a new form of creative environment.\n\nIt is the function of any “city” to create a sense of belonging, a sense of identity. A virtual architecture must serve the function of helping to create this sense of a whole, and of a social connection between the spaces and the people that from time to time inhabit them. This function can be served (amongst other techniques) by the creation of social environments (situations) designed to stimulate the creation of shared social experiences.\n\nIt is impossible in advance to anticipate the activities that will take place within this space, these will change rapidly with the temporal nature of the programme. It is important therefore that the architecture can change and respond to these forces at a similar pace. The project aims to achieve this by combining in powerful new ways the creative flexibility of virtual representations, with the low cost and adaptability of temporary structures.\n\n“The construction, the production of spaces of New Babylon will be the work of the New Babylonians themselves.”\n\nThe Collaboration\nThe construction of this space needs to be a collaborative partnership. We are proposing a partnership between three or four key European Architectural Schools, and a project that could feasibly start in November 2002. \n\nWe are independently organising an event in London to take place at the Architectural Association, around the 5th of November, and this fits with the proposed November 4th date for Mediaterra 2002. As a starting point we are creating a prototype which we will be erecting in a performance in London in June of this year.\n\nWe will also be working with an Architectural University in Istanbul, and because of the strong cultural links between London and both the Turkish and Greek communities, we are proposing that we engage these three centres in the creation of this new collaborative platform.\n\n\n“As the world turns into a single vast city and an exploding, increasingly mobile population has less room to move, a new relationship between space and psychology is needed”.\n\nA Social Intimacy\nPrivate space as exemplified by the modern notion of the domestic unit, situated within an increasingly homogenous and anonymous urban environment, presents a formidable obstacle for architects, planners, and idealists struggling to create, or recreate forms of social interaction – once deemed essential to our definition as human beings. Family has been replaced by powerful forms of mass entertainment, neighbours by legal obligations.\n\n\n“This ‘endless expanse’ of interior space is artificially lit and air-conditioned. Its inhabitants are given access to powerful, ambience-creating resources to construct their own spaces whenever and wherever they desire.”\n\nEvolutionary Growth\nThe project takes a pragmatic approach to the creation of this space. Resources must be found for it’s creation, from within the reach of existing art, new media and architectural bodies. Temporary structures need not be expensive to implement. Virtual spaces can be constructed using personal computers and existing resources. Sponsorship and government funding for such initiatives is not an unrealistic prospect.\n\n\nSite Specific\nWhile much abused this is a term, which in this context has a great deal of innovative power. The aspirations of the situationalist movement were largely frustrated by the inability to construct a physical space, which embodies the relevant psychogeographical values they sought to embody. The format we propose goes some way to offering a platform for a new field of social research.\n\nThrough the careful selection of individual sites and their incorporation into a unified whole within a virtual domain – we hope to strike a new balance between the social and the intimate. The sites become “interconnected”, and through “perverse” or other modalities of “curation”, a wide and unique variety of social domains can be created within the constraints of finite resources.\n\n\nMembrane Theory\nIn order to demean the role of technology in the creation of virtual interfaces between (temporary) physical structures, we have adopted this term to describe the multifarious techniques that artist and technicians can adopt to facilitate the extension of physical space into the virtual.\n\nWe don’t attempt to outline all the variety of forms that such membranes can take, now or in the future, but instead give the term a functional description which can be realised in any number of concrete implementations.\n\nMembranes are any devise or structure, which forms a causal gateway, however indirectly mediated between two physical locations. Furthermore this gateway must be capable of transmitting meaning – however this is defined, and the direction of this transmission must be at the very least bi-directional. \n\nThe use of the term “membrane” is designed to emphasise the spatial aspect of the physical surface of the interaction between individuals or an audience and the virtually mediated recipient of the communication. We use the terms “virtually mediated” and “indirectly mediated” interchangeably. This mediation may be via a conventional telephone exchange or an elaborate virtual environment, we emphasise here the nature of the physical interface not the technology underpinning this interface.\n\nMembranes can also be conceived of as a (virtual) no-mans land between the permanently evolving virtual representation and its temporal interfaces with the real world. In this representation the “virtual city” seeks to reach out, both transforming the real landscape, and moulding it’s inherently flexible virtual space to create temporary interfaces to the inhabitants of the “real”.\n\n\nExemplars\nToo much of the research in this area remains trapped within an academic or theoretical domain, while at the same time vast sums are spent on a technological research programme dictated by the key sponsors in the field.\n\nA pragmatic approach says that it is possible to explore this domain in the present – by connecting physical spaces using existing technologies within a coherent and evolving conceptual framework. \n\nBelow we outline the technologies that we can use to create the installations, and then we tentatively suggest some practical projects that could be used to take the first steps to realising this vision. The aim however is to work with groups and individuals, each of which would have complete autonomy to create their own interpretations of these interfaces, here we just provide pointers:\n\nStreaming Media\nNot rocket science, nor prohibitively expensive – streaming text (chat), video and audio open up numerous possibilities currently being explored by artists and technicians.\n\nMobile Media\nText messaging (SMS), wireless ethernet, BlueTooth and the emerging G3 networks, open up new and affordable technologies for artists and cultural innovators to explore in the context of interconnected site-specific works.\n\nThe Telephone\nSimple effective and not a prohibitively expensive technology for the communication of sound and audio environments. An invaluable resource for the exploration of public interaction.\n\nComputer Mediated Transformations\nWhile not emphasised elsewhere in this document the remarkable power of computers to transform information into visual and other representations capable of transmitting meaning to human beings is at the core of this proposal. Sensors can map movement and spatial position transforming these into spatial images. Software can mediate and facilitate debate, whether through simple chat rooms or AI mediated discussion forums. These areas are only just beginning to be explored.\n\nShadow Walls – “cut-outs”\nTwo way video conferencing can take on any number of forms. Bandwidth can be decreased by filtering out the colour information, or superimposing the moving portions of an image on virtual or drawn static imagery. Bandwidth reduction can allow multiple streams to be presented – writ large- in a physical space, installation or in the jargon of this proposal – membrane.\n\nTactile interfaces\nArtists can use imagery, surfaces and constructions to help create a sense of physical extension of a space. Machines (Braille keyboards for instance) can be cannibalised to transmit touch across geographical or temporal dimensions.\n\nFigure x\n\n\nVirtual Extensions\nReal spaces can be modelled, and then extensions of these spaces created on a computer. Projection of these new virtual extensions, drawings or other graphical derivations can then be applied back to the physical spaces in order to create the impression of the physical merging into the virtual.\n\n\nSpatial Collage\nArtists, architects and technicians can take images and drawings of sites, and “join” these together by using the techniques of traditional collage, or by creating virtual transitions between the images. Architects and 3D artists have a particularly important role here in taking the tradition of collage and applying it to real environments, and the interventions applied to them.\n\n\nTime-lapsed figurative painting\nThe causal connection between spaces need not be real-time. Time-lapse photography is a powerful technique that can be applied using low cost technology to low bandwidth internet connections providing multidimensional image streams for the use in “membrane” installations. \n\nAnon is working with the Anglo-Greek artist Eva Bensasson to develop photographic and video techniques that allow the processing of a video stream into a series of still images with the figures removed to create “cut-outs”.\n\nEven “slower” techniques can have their place in the implementation of specific “membrane”. Hand drawn images, surfaces constructed out of message exchanges, postcards or other forms of communication which make take many days to have a causal effect on the space are also to be encouraged.\n\n\nASCII Walls\nAnon has developed a number of techniques based on the tradition of ASCII Art. These include the ability to turn video streams into sequences of images made from text which are viewable as video, or the ability to create images from large bodies of text taken from live conversation or any textual sources – to create for instance large scale landscapes constructed out of coloured text.\n\n\n\fFootnotes and Elaboration\n\n\nThe Festival as an ephemeral “structure”\nFestivals are natural candidates for the creation and utilisation of ephemeral or temporary architectural structures – although their application has to date not fully been explored. \n\nSituationalists and others have long been aware of this relationship, but the creation of an event specifically situated in an ephemeral “city” designed and created by architects and artists has yet to be realised. This proposal brings together a number of strands that make this prospect feasible.\n\nFurthermore festivals are cyclic, they repeat at regular intervals, and as such can be conceived as temporal windows on something more conceptually permanent. In this context smaller scale projects can be initiated which over time evolve and grow, with structures and techniques being reused, refined and developed until such time as the full vision can be said to have been realised.\n\n\nVirtual Architecture as “persistence”\nThe role of architecture in this paradigm is precisely to create a coherence or permanence over time. It is also to create spatial visualisations of the social interconnections and situations” that these temporally and spatially disparate events create. It is to make this “city” feel like a city. It is to give a “birds eye view” of the space to whose inhabitants otherwise only perceive / conceive of the immediate extent of the environment in front of them.\n\nIt is also not only to describe this space, but to help (alongside others) to create and define it’s potential as it evolves over time. This is a deeply creative interdisciplinary activity which undertakes not only to map out the psychogeography of this domain, but also to explore it’s social, economic and political aspects – in cyberspace this architecture becomes a literal social architecture of human relations.\n\n\nArchitecture as a Constitution for a Global Culture\nThe architecture of a virtual city, becomes one and the same as the architecture or topographical relations between its citizens. It is intimately tied to the structure of the communications that this structure permits, who communicates to whom and when. How decisions are to be made. \n\nThese are the structures required no more and no less by our global democracy. It is an opportunity to define spaces in which intimacy and openness can be combined to create new forms of democratic decision making.\n\n\nAnticipation as a first line of defence\nThe history of many movements – the situationalist included, is peppered with examples of their eventual assimilation and / or decline in the face of mainstream economic and geopolitical influences. While at this stage no more than a metaphorical dream, there exists a glimmer of hope in the notion that an architecture for a global or unitary city, could create structures which have the power to resist these forces of assimilation and decay. This will only happen if architecture moves over to undertake areas of research which include the constitutional and economic (as below).\n\nHistorically, cities have walls, defences from external attack. They have systems of internal regulation, a politics, a police force, rules for economic activity, they have armies. Virtual cities may require similar mechanisms to preserve their culture, but they are also free to define new ways to achieve the same ends. The word constitution has two meanings: \n\nThe laws and principles according to which a (city) state is governed.\nThe general physical structure and condition of a persons body.\n\nBoth are related to the health of the being concerned, both relate to the defences and structures required to defend this body from internal and external attack.\n\n\nThe Economics of sustainable Creation\nIn the face of the realities of funding situation that most academic institutions are presented, and the dangers and predatory instincts of the commercial organisations that will seek to take advantage of any new initiatives that may come form the creative sector, it is not unreasonable to seek robust economic models that can sustain such an initiative over the longer term.\n\nIt is therefore vital that not only are there multiple revenue streams created for this initiative, but also that the project is not dependent on any singular source of funding for it’s existence. \n\nThe very aspects of this project that give it potential to create a concrete vision of Constant’s “New Babylon”, also facilitate experimentation and innovation in terms of the economic models which can sustain the activities. Virtual currencies, Time Banks, and other non-cash economies can be used to great effect to channel the energy and motivation of artists and new generations in the production of a global festival village – or a New Babylon for the 21st centuary."
