More recently (early 2000's), when I became interested in complexity, and particularly in the deep need for human tools to enable us more effectively to engage with problems like climate change, economies etc., I realised that the Pattern Language approach was not so much a tool for architecture as it was a tool for mapping complex domains.\n"
