      "text": "In 1929, Joseph Russell Smith took up an antecedent term as the subtitle for ''Tree Crops: A Permanent Agriculture'', a book in which he summed up his long experience experimenting with fruits and nuts as crops for human food and animal feed.[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0PQvqpVnFbAC&lpg=PP1 ]  Smith saw the world as an inter-related whole and suggested mixed systems of trees and crops underneath. This book inspired many individuals intent on making agriculture more sustainable, such as [[Toyohiko Kagawa]] who pioneered [[forest farming]] in [[Japan]] in the 1930s. - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture#History wikipedia]"

      "text": "The definition of permanent agriculture as that which can be sustained indefinitely was supported by Australian [[P. A. Yeomans]] in his 1964 book ''Water for Every Farm''. Yeomans introduced an observation-based approach to land use in Australia in the 1940s, and the [[keyline design]] as a way of managing the supply and distribution of water in the 1950s."
