This is the first principle, because without a healthy earth, [[human]]s cannot flourish.\n* '''''Care for the people''''': Provision for people to access those resources necessary for their existence.\n* '''''Return of surplus''''': Reinvesting surpluses back into the system to provide for the first two ethics. This includes returning waste back into the system to recycle into usefulness.[http://www.scottlondon.com/interviews/mollison.html Permaculture: A Quiet Revolution] The third ethic is sometimes referred to as Fair Share to reflect that each of us should take no more than what we need before we reinvest the surplus."

      "text": "Permaculture design emphasizes patterns of [[landscape]], function, and species assemblies.  It determines where these elements should be placed so they can provide maximum benefit to the local environment. The central concept of permaculture is maximizing useful connections between components and [[synergy]] of the final design. The focus of permaculture, therefore, is not on each separate element, but rather on the relationships created among elements by the way they are placed together; the whole becoming greater than the sum of its parts ([[Emergence]]). Permaculture design therefore seeks to minimize [[waste]], human labor, and energy input by building systems with maximal benefits between design elements to achieve a high level of [[synergy]]. Permaculture designs evolve over time by taking into account these relationships and elements and can become extremely complex systems that produce a high density of food and materials with minimal input.[http://www.edibleforestgardens.com/ Edible Forest Gardening]"

      "text": "The design principles which are the conceptual foundation of permaculture were derived from the science of [[systems ecology]] and study of pre-industrial examples of [[sustainable]] land use. Permaculture draws from several disciplines including [[organic farming]], [[agroforestry]], [[integrated farming]], [[sustainable development]], and [[applied ecology]].[ ] Permaculture has been applied most commonly to the design of housing and landscaping, integrating techniques such as [[agroforestry]], [[natural building]], and [[rainwater harvesting]] within the context of permaculture design principles and theory."
