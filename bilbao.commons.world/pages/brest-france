The importance of Brest in [[medieval]] times was great enough to give rise to the saying, \"He is not the Duke of Brittany who is not the Lord of Brest\". With the marriage of [[Francis I of France]] to Claude ([[Claude of France]]), the daughter of [[Anne of Brittany]], the definitive overlordship of Brest – together with the rest of the duchy – passed to the [[French crown]]."

      "text": "During the Middle Ages, the history of Brest was the history of its castle. Then Richelieu made it a military harbour. Brest grew around its arsenal, until the second part of the 20th century. Heavily damaged by the Allies' bombing raids during World War II, the city centre was completely rebuilt after the war. At the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, the deindustrialization of the city was followed by the development of the service sector. Nowadays, Brest is an important university town with 23,000 students. Besides a multidisciplinary university, the University of Western Brittany, Brest and its surrounding area possess several prestigious French elite schools such as École Navale (the French Naval Academy), Télécom Bretagne and the Superior National School of Advanced Techniques of Brittany (ENSTA Bretagne, formerly ENSIETA). Brest is also an important research centre, mainly focused on the sea, with among others the largest Ifremer (French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea) centre, le Cedre (Centre of Documentation, Research and Experimentation on Accidental Water Pollution) and the French Polar Institute."

In 1342, [[John IV, Duke of Brittany]], surrendered Brest to the English, in whose possession it was to remain until 1397. The importance of Brest in [[medieval]] times was great enough to give rise to the saying, \"He is not the Duke of Brittany who is not the Lord of Brest\". With the marriage of [[Francis I of France]] to Claude ([[Claude of France]]), the daughter of [[Anne of Brittany]], the definitive overlordship of Brest – together with the rest of the duchy – passed to the [[French crown]]."

Fortifications  by Vauban ([[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban]]) (1633–1707) followed in 1680–1688. These fortifications, and with them the naval importance of the town, were to continue to develop throughout the 18th century."
