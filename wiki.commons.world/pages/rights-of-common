The Act effectively preserved such rights as were registered, although hitherto rights would have been likely to evolve through the years.

However, over 12,000 rights entries appear on the Welsh registers, and 24,000 in England. Over half of the common land area of England has over 20 rights registered. \n\nWhilst land was formerly used communally for a diverse range of domestic and agricultural purposes, it is only certain categories of common rights which have survived with any certainty today."
