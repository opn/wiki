This small section hosts many [[Machinima]] videos (see [[Machinima: Virtual Filmmaking]]). [[Machinima]] is a digital artform in which [[computer games]], [[game engines]] or software engine are used in a sandbox mode like mode to create motion pictures, recreate plays or even publish presentations/keynotes. The archive collects a range of [[Machinima]] films from internet publishers such as Rooster Teeth ([[Rooster Teeth Productions]]) and [[Machinima.com]] as well as independent producers. The sub collection is a collaborative effort between the Internet Archive, the How They Got Game research project at Stanford University, the Academy of Machinima Arts and Sciences and Machinima.com."
