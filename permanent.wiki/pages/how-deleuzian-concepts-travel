The coherence among the various bits shifts from one work to the next as new concepts are added, fresh problems addressed; it is not given by ‘logical consistency’ among propositions, but rather by the ‘series’ or ‘plateaus’ into which the conceptual pieces enter or settle along the web of their interrelations … The bits thus don’t work together like parts in a well-formed organism or a purposeful mechanism or a well-formed narrative—the whole is not given, and things are always starting up again in the middle, falling together in another looser way. As one thus passes from one zone or ‘plateau’ to another and back again, one thus has nothing of the sense of a well-planned itinerary; on the contrary, one is taken on a sort of conceptual trip for which there preexists no map—a voyage for which one must leave one’s usual discourse behind and never be quite sure where one will land.\" (pp. 21–22)\n\nRajchman, J.
