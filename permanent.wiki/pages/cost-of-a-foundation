        "text": "Council on Foundations research shows the majority of private foundations with assets of $5 million to $9.9 million have part-time staff only. The following calculations assume your half-time CEO salary and benefits are $38,7501 and your annual legal and accounting fees are $5,000:\n\nTotal Annual Charitable Budget\n$5,000,000 x .055 = $275,000 Assets x 5.5 percent = total annual charitable budget (grants + expenses)\n\nAdministrative Costs\n$275,000 x .15 = $41,250 Total annual charitable budget x 15 percent = administrative budget\n\nIn this case, because your total charitable budget is significantly larger than the previous example, you might consider the option of a half-time staff person. With your half-time CEO salary and benefits at $38,750 and your legal and accounting costs at approximately $5,000, administrative costs total $43,750, which exceeds the recommended 15 percent administrative ceiling. Therefore, you might consider hiring a lower-compensated staff person such as a program officer or administrative assistant, with the board retaining many responsibilities, or hiring a CEO with legal or accounting skills so that the $5,000 fee is reduced.\n\nExample 3: $10 Million Foundation (Half-Time CEO and Half-Time Administrative Assistant)\nIn this case, your annual charitable budget is an amount that realistically allows you to consider the option of hiring a half-time CEO and a half-time administrative assistant. Assuming that your half-time CEO and half-time administrative assistant salary/benefits are $68,7502 and your annual legal and accounting fees are $5,000:\n\nTotal Annual Charitable Budget\n$10,000,000 x .055 = $550,000 Assets x 5.5 percent = total annual charitable budget (grants + expenses)\n\nAdministrative Costs\n$550,000 x .15 = $82,500 Total annual charitable budget x 15 percent = administrative budget\n\nAdding personnel and legal and accounting costs gives you a total of $73,750 for administrative costs. In this example, your administrative costs will be 13.4 percent of your annual charitable budget, which is below the 15 percent recommended ceiling.\n\nAs noted above, there are many options available to manage a private foundation. Our research indicates that many families opt for more than one philanthropic tool, each fulfilling a different goal. For example, in preliminary data from the 2002 Foundation Management Survey, 11 percent of the family foundations responding also had donor advised funds at community foundations.\n\nThe costs related to starting a foundation on the state level will vary from one state to the next and depend on the type of structure (e.g., trust or corporation, public charity, or private foundation) chosen for the foundation. State fees are paid with submission of required documents to the state office that is responsible for regulating charities; usually this is the secretary of state or the attorney generalâ€™s office. In addition, there are fees associated with seeking recognition of charity status with the IRS. Finally, there may be licensing or other fees required for operation of any business in a particular area."
