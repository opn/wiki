Make sure that it reflects what you're capturing.\n\nIn \"research-label=\" do the same thing as before, just take away strange characters (accents, non alphanumerics, accents...) and also take away spaces\n\nIn \"research-geo=clat,clng,minlat,minlng,maxlat,maxlng\" replace \"clat,clng,minlat,minlng,maxlat,maxlng\" with the description of the geographical area which you would like to observe.\nHere:\nreplace \"clat\" with the center latitude of the area (ex.: 49.2)\nreplace \"clng\" with the center longitude of the area (ex.: 12.6)\nreplace \"minlat\" with the minimum latitude of the area (ex.: 49.1)\nreplace \"minlng\" with the minimum longitude of the area (ex.: 12.5)\nreplace \"maxlat\" with the maximum latitude of the area (ex.: 49.3)\nreplace \"maxlng\" with the maximum longitude of the area (ex.: 12.7)\n\n\"minlat,minlng,maxlat,maxlng\" form the geographical bounding box of your observation.\nNote that theoretically you can put even a very large area in. But you will have to face the fact that if you do that you will generate a *large* size of information (and thus will need to store it on your DB, which could not allow you to store the multiple TeraBytes of data generated), and that if a large area is specified, multiple different harvesting threads will be started at the same time, possibly completely hanging your computer, consuming all of its bandwith and processing power.\n\nWe will provide with a separate tutorial on how to configure large geo areas, separately.\n\nIf your observation is location independent, just leave the item blank (e.g.: it becomes \"research-geo=\" , with nothing after it).\n\nIn \"research-classes=class1,class2,...\" configure the \"classes\" of things which you would like to capture.\n\nThere are multiple options.\n\nIf you have a geographical area set and would like to capture everything in it, just provide one class named \"Everything\". Thus it would become \"research-classes=Everything\"\n\nIn all of the other cases, list what is roughly the list of topic names you want to listen to.\nFor example, if you want to listen to what people are saying about Associations, it could be \"research-classes=Associations,Volunteering,NGOs\".\n\nDon't worry about being too specific, you will do it in the next step. For now just include broad topics you would like to listen to.\n\nUse your \"research-words=word1,word2,...:word1,word2,...\" to fine tune, for each class, the starting words or phrases used for listening.\n\nIn the previous example, listening to Associations could mean starting the search from the words/phrases \"association\", in different languages (such as \"association, associazione,asociación,verein\", in english, italian, spanish and german).\n\nFor Volunteering it could be \"volontariato,volunteering,ehrenamtliche arbeit,volontariat,voluntariado\".\n\nFor NGOs it could be \"ngo,ong,Nicht-Regierungsorganisationen,organisations non-gouvernementales,organizaciones no gubernamentales,non-governmental organizations\".\n\nEach word/phrase can be maximum 255 characters long.\n\nIn this case the resulting configuration could be:\n\nresearch-words=association,associazione,asociación,verein:volontariato,volunteering,ehrenamtliche arbeit,volontariat,voluntariado:ngo,ong,Nicht-Regierungsorganisationen,organisations non-gouvernementales,organizaciones no gubernamentales,non-governmental organizations\n\nNote that the \"|\" characters split the various word/phrases lists for the various topics, and that order is important: the first class goes with the first list, the second class goes with the second list, and so on.\n"
