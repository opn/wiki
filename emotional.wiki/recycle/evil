Peck characterizes evil as a malignant type of self-righteousness in which there is an active rather than passive refusal to tolerate imperfection (sin) and its consequent guilt.<ref name=\"Roadmult\" /><ref name=\"Liemult\" /> This syndrome results in a projection ([[psychological projection]]) of evil onto selected specific innocent victims (often children), which is the paradoxical mechanism by which the People of the Lie commit their evil.<ref name=\"Liemult\"/> Peck argues that these people are the most difficult of all to deal with, and extremely hard to identify.<ref name=\"Liemult\"/> He describes in some detail several individual cases involving his patients. In one case which Peck considers as the most typical because of its subtlety, he describes Roger, a depressed teenage son of respected, well off parents.<ref name=\"Liemult\"/> In a series of parental decisions justified by often subtle distortions of the truth, they exhibit a consistent disregard for their son's feelings, and a consistent willingness to destroy his growth. With false rationality and normality, they aggressively refuse to consider that they are in any way responsible for his resultant depression, eventually suggesting his condition must be incurable and genetic."

Peck considers those he calls evil to be attempting to escape and hide from their own conscience (through self-deception), and views this as being quite distinct from the apparent absence of conscience evident in sociopathy ([[Psychopathy]]).<ref name=\"Liemult\" />"

He argued that a diagnosis of evil should come from the standpoint of healing and safety for its victims, but also with the possibility even if remote, that the evil themselves may be cured."

He describes it thus: Every person stands at a crossroads, with one path leading to God, and the other path leading to the devil. The path of God is the right path, and accepting this path is akin to submission to a higher power. However, if a person wants to convince himself and others that he has free choice, he would rather take a path which cannot be attributed to its being the right path. Thus, he chooses the path of evil."

        "text": "Peck also discussed the question of the devil.<ref name=\"Liemult\" /> Initially he believed, as with ‘99% of psychiatrists and the majority of clergy’ (Peck, 1983/1988,<ref name=\"Liemult\" /> p182), that the devil did not exist; but, after starting to believe in the reality of human evil, he then began to contemplate the reality of spiritual evil. Eventually, after having been referred several possible cases of possession and being involved in two exorcisms, he was converted to a belief in the existence of Satan. Peck considered people who are possessed as being victims of evil, but of not being evil themselves.  Peck however considered possession to be rare, and human evil common. He did believe there was some relationship between Satan and human evil, but was unsure of its exact nature. Peck's writings and views on possession and exorcism are to some extent influenced and based on specific accounts by [[Malachi Martin]], however the veracity of these accounts and Peck's own diagnostic approach to possession have both since been questioned by a Catholic priest who is a professor of theology.[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_26_41/ai_n13679235/ The devil you know] It has been argued that it is not possible to find formal records to establish the veracity of Father [[Malachi Martin]]'s described cases of possession, as all exorcism files are sealed by the [[Archdiocese of New York]], where all but one of the cases took place.[http://geocities.com/whkinfo1/malachi_martinsophia.htm In Defense of Father Malachi Martin]"
