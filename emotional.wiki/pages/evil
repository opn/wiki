        "text": "Peck also discussed the question of the devil.<ref name=\"Liemult\" /> Initially he believed, as with ‘99% of psychiatrists and the majority of clergy’ (Peck, 1983/1988,<ref name=\"Liemult\" /> p182), that the devil did not exist; but, after starting to believe in the reality of human evil, he then began to contemplate the reality of spiritual evil. Eventually, after having been referred several possible cases of possession and being involved in two exorcisms, he was converted to a belief in the existence of Satan. Peck considered people who are possessed as being victims of evil, but of not being evil themselves.  Peck however considered possession to be rare, and human evil common. He did believe there was some relationship between Satan and human evil, but was unsure of its exact nature. Peck's writings and views on possession and exorcism are to some extent influenced and based on specific accounts by [[Malachi Martin]], however the veracity of these accounts and Peck's own diagnostic approach to possession have both since been questioned by a Catholic priest who is a professor of theology.[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_26_41/ai_n13679235/ The devil you know] It has been argued that it is not possible to find formal records to establish the veracity of Father [[Malachi Martin]]'s described cases of possession, as all exorcism files are sealed by the [[Archdiocese of New York]], where all but one of the cases took place.[http://geocities.com/whkinfo1/malachi_martinsophia.htm In Defense of Father Malachi Martin]",
