Needham was educated at [[Oundle School]] (founded in 1556 in [[Northamptonshire]]) before attending [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], where he graduated [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1921, [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin)]] in January 1925, and [[DPhil]] in October 1925. He had intended to study medicine, but came under the influence of [[Frederick Hopkins]], resulting in his switch to [[biochemistry]] - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Needham#Early_years wikipedia]"

His [[Terry Lecture]] of 1936 was published by [[Cambridge University Press]] in association with [[Yale University Press]] under the title of ''Order and Life''. In 1939 he produced a massive work on [[morphogenesis]] that a Harvard reviewer claimed \"will go down in the history of science as Joseph Needham's ''magnum opus,''\" little knowing what would come later - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Needham#Career wikipedia]"

His longest trip in late 1943 ended in far west in [[Gansu]] at the caves in [[Dunhuang]] at the end of the [[Great Wall]] where the earliest dated printed book - a copy of the [[Diamond Sutra]] - was found. The other long trip reached [[Fuzhou]] on the east coast, returning across the [[Xiang River]] just two days before the Japanese blew up the bridge at [[Hengyang]] and cut off that part of China. In 1944 he visited [[Yunnan]] in an attempt to reach the Burmese border. Everywhere he went he purchased and was given old historical and scientific books which he shipped back to Britain through diplomatic channels. They were to form the foundation of his later research. He got to know [[Zhou Enlai]] and met numerous Chinese scholars, including the painter [[Wu Zuoren]], and the meteorologist [[Zhu Kezhen]], who later sent crates of books to him in Cambridge, including 2,000 volumes of the ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' encyclopaedia, a comprehensive record of China's past."

His left-wing stance was based in an idiosyncratic form of [[Christian socialism]] and after 1949 his sympathy with Chinese culture was extended to the new government. During his stay in China, Needham was asked to analyse some cattle-cakes that had been scattered by American aircraft in the south of China at the end of World War II, and found they were impregnated with [[anthrax]]. During the [[Korean War]] further accusations were made that the Americans had used [[biological warfare]]. [[Zhou Enlai]] coordinated an international campaign to enlist Needham for a study commission, tacitly offering access to materials and contacts in China needed for his then early research. Needham agreed to be an inspector in [[North Korea]] and his report supported the [[Germ warfare in the Korean War]]. After post-[[Cold War]] revelations that the [[Soviet Union]] had assisted the Chinese in setting up false scenarios, Needham's biographer [[Simon Winchester]] commented that \"Needham was intellectually in love with communism; and yet communist spymasters and agents, it turned out, had pitilessly duped him.\" Needham was blacklisted by the US government until well into the 1970s - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Needham#Political_involvement wikipedia]"
