Anything over 15% is remarkable, and usually gains a reputation for being a high technology company such as  engineering company [[Ericsson]] 24.9%, or [[Allergan]] a [[biotech]] company,  tops the spending table with 43.4% investment Such companies are often seen as [[credit risk]]s because their spending ratios are so unusual."

The extreme needs justify the high risk of failure and consequently high gross margins from 60% to 90% of revenues. That is, [[gross profit]]s will be as much as 90% of the sales cost, with manufacturing costing only 10% of the product price, because so many individual projects yield no exploitable product. Most industrial companies get 40% revenues only."
