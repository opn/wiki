How can referees receive credit or recognition for their work, and what form should this take;\n2. Should referee reports be published alongside manuscripts;\n3. Should referees remain anonymous or have their identities disclosed;\n4. Should peer review occur prior or subsequent to the publication process (i.e., publish then filter)."
