Re-Orient criticizes Needham for his [[Eurocentric]] assumptions borrowed from [[Marx]] and the presupposition of Needham's famous Grand Question that science was a uniquely Western phenomenon. \n"

As Needham found more and more evidence about science and technology in China, he struggled to liberate himself from his Eurocentric original sin, which he had inherited directly from Marx, as Cohen also observes.\n<p>\nBut Needham never quite succeeded, perhaps because his concentration on China prevented him from sufficiently revising his still ethnocentric view of Europe itself.\n</blockquote>"

Barrett asserts in ''The Woman Who Discovered Printing'' that Needham was unduly critical of [[Buddhism]], describing it as having 'tragically played a part in strangling the growth of Chinese science,' to which Needham readily conceded in a conversation a few years later. Barrett also criticizes Needham's favoritism and uncritical evaluation of [[Taoism]] in Chinese technological history:"

      "text": "He had a tendency— not entirely justified in the light of more recent research— to think well of Taoism, because he saw it as playing a part that could not be found elsewhere in Chinese civilization. The mainstream school of thinking of the bureaucratic Chinese elite, or '[[Confucianism]]' (another problematic term) in his vocabulary, seemed to him to be less interested in science and technology, and to have 'turned its face away from Nature.' Ironically, the dynasty that apparently turned away from printing from 706 till its demise in 907 was as Taoist as any in Chinese history, though perhaps its 'state Taoism' would have seemed a corrupt and inauthentic business to Needham."
