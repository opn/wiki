      "text": "The actual construction of citation graphs can be complicated in practice as there is often no standard format for the citations in a bibliography. This makes the record linkage of the citations in a document to their cited document time consuming. Worse there are often errors in the citations introduced at any one of many stages of the process of publishing a document. However there is a long history of creating a database of citations, also known as a citation index, and so there is lot of information about such problems."

      "text": "In principle each document will have a unique publication date and can only refer to earlier documents. This means that the edges of the graph are not only directed but they are also acyclic, that is there are no loops in the graph. So a perfect citation graph is an example of a directed acyclic graph. In practice this is not always true, for instance an academic paper goes through several versions in the publishing process and it may be possible to update bibliographies at different times in such a way to lead to edges that apparently point forward in time. However in practice it appears such citations are often less than 1% of the total number of links."
