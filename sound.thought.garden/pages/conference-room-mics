        "text": "- [[Gooseneck Mics]]\nGiven the name gooseneck for their uncanny resembles to, well, a Goose’s neck, these microphones are generally considered the best way to ensure perfect quality audio. Each individual seat will require its own gooseneck, so that each individual speaker has their own dedicated microphone.\n\n\n\nSo, instead of relying on one or two microphones to hopefully pick up every single person’s voice, gooseneck mics ensure that everyone is heard. Unlike the previously mentioned ceiling mics, since goosenecks are limited to the speaker, they generally won’t be picking up those annoying background noises. However, the trade off is mainly that you’ll need to ensure there are enough mics on the table for all speakers, which adds a lot more clutter and cables to worry about.\n\nPros\n\nGooseneck mics are one of the best ways to ensure that every single speaker is heard, and heard crystal clear. Everyone sitting around the conference table should have their own mic, instead of sharing one for the entire room.\nThese mics can help prevent annoying background noise by limiting their capabilities to only pick up the sound right in front of them.\nCons\n\nDepending on how many mics your conference room needs, this could lead to a lot of clutter and unwanted cables on the desk — although it is possible to find wireless gooseneck mics, you still have multiple microphones sitting on the desk.\nLet’s face it, gooseneck mics are pretty darn ugly. No one wants to mess up their office Feng Shui with some ugly mics lined on the table, but it’s a price you might have to pay for the enhanced quality."
