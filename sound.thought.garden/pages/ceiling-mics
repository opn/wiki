While other microphones take up space and sit on the table, ceiling mics cut down on visible wires, and stay out of the way.\n- Microphones can either hang, or mount right into the ceiling for a much cleaner presentation capable of picking up audio from any direction, even in the largest rooms.\n\n# Cons\n\n- Installation might require forward planning, so that you don’t have to rip open your ceiling or walls to install these mics.\n- While microphones are growing more intelligent, these mics can still frequently pick up background noise in the room, and generally aren’t of the same quality as dedicated microphones."
