      "text": "The flagship event of the foundation is the invitation-only annual meeting held during the winter at the end of January in Davos, Switzerland, bringing together chief executive officers from its 1,000 member companies, as well as selected politicians, representatives from [[academia]], [[NGOs]], religious leaders, and the media in an [[Swiss Alps]] winter environment. The town is small enough to allow participants to meet anywhere outside the sessions and allows them the greatest opportunities to attend receptions organized by companies and countries. The participants are also taking part in role playing events, such as the Investment Heat Map. Informal winter meetings may have led to as many ideas and solutions as the official sessions. Approximately 2,200 participants gather for the five-day event and attend some of the 220 sessions in the official programme. The winter discussions focus around key issues of global concern (such as the [[globalization]], capital markets, wealth management, international conflicts, environmental problems and their possible solutions) - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum#Annual_meeting_in_Davos wikipedia]"

Not all the journalists are given access to all areas, however. This is reserved for white badge holders. \"Davos runs an almost caste-like system of badges,\" according to BBC journalist Anthony Reuben. \"A white badge means you're one of the delegates â€“ you might be the chief executive of a company or the leader of a country (although that would also get you a little holographic sticker to add to your badge), or a senior journalist. An orange badge means you're just a run-of-the-mill working journalist.\""
