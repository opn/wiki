        "text": "In his ''Reading Rooms'', Barber worked with [[Alexander Rodchenko]]'s 1925 Reading Room as a model for a workers' library and study.  These multi-part installations made use of multi-media formats to re-present various forms of corporate advertising and news reporting.  The Red Room addressed the construction of masculinity through media representation.  The imagery used for critical readings was obtained from various sites of popular culture including film, advertising, war history, weapons magazines and comic books.  The ''Newsroom'' section contained newspaper accounts of male violence; the ''Viewsroom'' contained slide projections; the ''Videoroom'' contained video footage of x-rated films and a Marvin cartoon satirising male parenting behaviour; the ''Theory/Criticism Room'' provided tools with which readers could alter a selection of magazines.  A theoretical essay titled \"Excision, Detournement and Reading the Open Text\" elaborated the process they would have then been using.  Among some of the aphorisms contained in this essay are the following:"

Excising elements from the image confirms the existence of a primary context, pretexts and within the image itself, subtexts which disclose the competing economies of the sign(s)."
