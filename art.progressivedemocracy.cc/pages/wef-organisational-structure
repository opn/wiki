These enterprises rank among the top companies within their industry and/or country and play a leading role in shaping the future of their industry and/or region. Membership is stratified by the level of engagement with forum activities, with the level of membership fees increasing as participation in meetings, projects, and initiatives rises. As of 2011, an annual membership costs $52,000 for an individual member, $263,000 for \"Industry Partner\" and $527,000 for \"Strategic Partner\". An admission fee costs $19,000 per person. In 2014, WEF raised annual fees by 20 percent, making the cost for \"Strategic Partner\" from CHF 500,000 ($523,000) to CHF 600,000 ($628,000) - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum#Membership wikipedia]"
