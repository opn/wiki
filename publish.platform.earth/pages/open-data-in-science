It was built upon the so-called Bermuda Principles, stipulating that: \"All human genomic sequence information (…) should be freely available and in the public domain in order to encourage research and development and to maximise its benefit to society’. More recent initiatives such as the Structural Genomics Consortium have illustrated that the open data approach can also be used productively within the context of industrial R&D."

Following a request and an intense discussion with data-producing institutions in member states, the OECD published in 2007 the ''OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding'' as a ''soft-law'' recommendation."
