So called fail-stop failure mode occupies the simplest end of the spectrum. Whereas fail-stop failure model simply means that the only way to fail is a node crash, detected by other nodes, Byzantine failures imply no restrictions, which means that failed node can generate arbitrary data, pretending a correct one, which makes fault tolerance utterly difficult."

Correctly functioning components of a Byzantine fault tolerant system will be able to provide the system's service, assuming there are not too many faulty components."

A version of these definitions is also described in the Dependability Wikipedia page. The type of system services which Byzantine faults affect are agreement (a.k.a consensus) services."
