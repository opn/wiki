More information on this can be found in the Views and Output library pages. In some cases, however, you might want to post-process the finalized data in some way and send it to the browser yourself. revIgniter permits you to add a handler named _output to your controller that will receive the finalized output data.\n\nImportant:  If your controller contains a handler named _output, it will always be called by the output library instead of puting the finalized data directly. The first parameter of the handler will contain the finalized output.\n\nHere is an example:\n\ncommand _output pOutput\n\tput pOutput\nend _output\nPlease note that your _output handler will receive the data in its finalized state. Benchmark data will be rendered, cache files written (if you have caching enabled), and headers will be sent (if you use that feature) before it is handed off to the _output handler. If you are using this feature the page execution timer might not be perfectly accurate since it will not take into acccount any further processing you do. For an alternate way to control output before any of the final processing is done, please see the available handlers in the Output Library.\nPrivate Handlers\n\nIn some cases you may want certain handlers hidden from public access. To make a handler private, simply add an underscore as the name prefix and it will not be served via a URL request. For example, if you were to have a handler like this:\n\ncommand _utility\n\t-- some code\nend _utility\nTrying to access it via the URL, like this, will not work:\n\nexample.com/index.lc/blog/_utility/\nOrganizing Your Controllers into Sub-folders\n\nIf you are building a large application you might find it convenient to organize your controllers into sub-folders. revIgniter permits you to do this.\n\nSimply create folders within your application/controllers directory and place your controller libraries within them.\n\nNote:  When using this feature the first segment of your URI must specify the folder. For example, lets say you have a controller located here:\n\napplication/controllers/products/shoes.lc\nTo call the above controller your URI will look something like this:\n\nexample.com/index.lc/products/shoes/show/123\nEach of your sub-folders may contain a default controller which will be called if the URL contains only the sub-folder. Simply name your default controller as specified in your application/config/routes.lc file\n\nrevIgniter also permits you to remap your URIs using its URI Routing feature."
