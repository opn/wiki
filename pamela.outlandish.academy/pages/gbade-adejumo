According to him, conflicts vary in nature depending on the issues involved, the character of and relationship between the adversaries, the context and the means used to wage the struggle and the outcome. A conflict situation, therefore, arises when parties or groups in close proximity (whether physically or psychologically) feel that their interests and goals are incompatible (Albert, 2001). However, not all conflicts are negative or destructive. When conflicts are well-managed to achieve constructive results, they become positive conflicts."

In the first place, land was available in large quantity; hence pastoralists and farmers could pursue their occupation with minimum conflict.  Secondly, the population was relatively small and subsistent farming was in vogue. There was also a symbiotic relationship between farmers and herdsmen as farmers interested in livestock would keep their cattle with the pastoralists. When the pastoralists moved round in search of pasture in the dry season, they ensured that they drove through the farmers’ holdings after the latter had harvested their crops."

Therefore, there has been a very strong economic, nutritional and symbiotic relationship between farmers and pastoralists.

In considering the long term measure to resolving the problems, one solution that has been proffered is creation of grazing zones in the conflict - prone areas. How feasible is this solution? If creation of grazing zones cannot provide a long-term solution, then, alternative solution(s) should be proffered."

Perceptual filters include culture, ethnicity, gender and sexuality, knowledge, previous experiences in managing the conflicts, i.e. issues that may condition the attitudes of the parties to the present conflict (Tung –Tooney 1994). For instance, how much respect does an average Yoruba have for a Bororo Fulani and vice-versa?"

In such environment, incidence of unreliable rainfall creates an acute food shortage and unless livestock is few and closely integrated with crop  production, there is the probability of over grazing  which compounds the problem of environmental degradation (UNRISD, 1997)."

Nomadism and pastoralism are intertwined. Indeed, nomadism represents an integral, social, political and environment dimension of pastoralism. (Shettima & Tar: 2008; 165). "

In his own opinion, Deutsch (1977) says that conflict is an action which prevents, obstructs, interferes with, injures or renders ineffective, another action with which it is incompatible. "

In other words, conflict is fuelled and exaggerated by people’s perception of a problem rather than reality. There is also the issue of perceptual filters which influences people’s reactions to a conflict.   Furthermore, in many conflict situations, there is usually a significant level of misunderstanding of each other’s perceptions, needs and feelings. To a Fulani herdsman, for instance, his greatest concern is the survival of his cattle and he cannot understand why anybody should frown at his efforts in feeding his animals."

Thus, cooperation manifests in conflict handling through accommodation, collaboration, compromise etc. On the other hand, assertiveness is an attempt to satisfy one’s desires, goals and needs or pushing one’s position at the expense of the other party or parties to the conflict. The methods used here include arbitration and threats to the other party. (Ochinya Ojiji in Shedrack G Best:ed: 2006:120). "

At the heart of pastoralist versus farmers’ conflict is the changing pattern of pastoral movement from the late 19th century onwards. It is generally assumed that Fulbes (ie Fulanis) first arrived as nomads in the far north between 14th and 16th century. Attempts to move further south was checkmated by the incidence of animal diseases. Gallery forests along river banks which created an ideal breeding place for tsetse flies further discouraged southward movement (Blench and Dendo, 2004)."

Although improved technology and agricultural practices have significantly enhanced land usage, the totality of available land has not increased. With these scenario, it is not surprising that conflicts between farmers and herdsmen have continued to escalate. The issue of climate change and desertification has compounded the herder’s problems in that they are forced to move southwards in search of pasture and water for their herd."

The life of a typical Fulani revolves round his herd and he is prepared to go the extra mile in protecting his flock. In confronting the problem of dwindling grazing stock therefore, he is always on the move in search of pasture. The issue of climate change and the resultant desertification compounds his problems. In addition, there are occasional incidences of droughts which literally wipes out large numbers of cattle. These factors lead to desperation in the search for pasture by the Fulani herdsmen."

With many of the cattle tracks now turned to farms, friction frequently occur between the two parties.    "

The intra and interstate conflicts in Nigeria and West Africa aided illegal access to light weapons by the people. This problem of illegal access to weapons may have begun from the time of Nigeria/Biafra war of 1967 to 1970 .Since then, there have been fratricidal conflicts in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Cote D’voire etc. and dangerous weapons have been circulating virtually unhindered within the sub-region. This is a major cause of insecurity in the area. Nowadays, many Bororo Fulani herdsmen are said to carry sophisticated weapons like AK 47 guns which most probably were illegally acquired. The farmers of Saki West affirmed that many herdsmen are usually armed with dangerous weapons and this gives them the temerity to   enter farms and destroy crops with impunity. It was also alleged that the Bororo Fulanis got away with heinous crimes like robbery, murder, and rape in the area because of the sophisticated arms they carry. "

However, colonial masters created artificial boundaries which, in some cases, split ethnic groups into different countries. This situation compounded the problem of pastoralists."

Since such resources are inadequate for the need of all, there is competition for their usage and this can sometimes be fierce and destructive. A case in point is the competition for land between farmers and herdsman (pastoralists). Furthermore, imaginary consequences of a proposed action of a party or another can also lead to conflicts. A typical example is Sudan’s objection to Ethiopia’s plan to construct a hydro–electric dam on the Blue Nile. As her major source of water, Sudan feels that putting a dam across the river will deprive her of water supply. Also, conflict erupts when the distribution of resources is adjudged by a party to be unfair."

The effect of information manipulation in escalating the Rwanda genocide of 1994 is a typical example of how information dissemination can have catastrophic effects. A radio station goaded Hutus into killing Tutsis and moderate Hutus who were described as cockroaches. Even during Nigeria’s Civil War of 1966-70, information was manipulated on the radio which led to the killing of thousands of Igbos in the North. These are clear examples of how manipulation of information can have disastrous consequences."

He was also responsible for managing the conflicts between farmers and his group (Ellwood, 1995)."

Blench (2005;iv-16) puts this succinctly when he observes that if the Nigerian population is projected backwards to pre-colonial times, the human population, for what is today known as Nigeria,  may not be more than 10 million in the19th and early 20th century. Conversely, the land area of the Nigerian nation remains unchanged. If comparison is done between then and now,  the present population of 140 million (2006 population and housing census) poses greater stress and tension to the relationship of farmers and herders as the land area under cultivation in the earlier period would have been far less extensive than now. Hence, pastoralists and farmers at that time related with little or no friction."

Furthermore, the outcomes of non-violent resource conflict may include institutional rules which define categories of inclusion and exclusion to natural resources.

It could also involve collaborative efforts between farmers, to check resource exploitation by external actors. The actors may even decide to diversify into multiple sources of livelihood. In Borno State, for example, farmers move, in preference, from some particular crops to others. Farmers in Bama Local Government Area of the State were said to have stopped cultivating tomatoes (Shettima and Tar, 2008). "
