Given we don't know the difference between the local version (with halo) and other (which probably has less content) we are doing various cumbersome saves of local pages before \nclicking the X and then reinstating missing information. We don't know why (i.e. what we are doing) that causes some pages to get the halo and othres don't.   \n- Why has the [[Andrew Orford]] page called itself andrew-orford?\n- Green Halo - on recent changes page and local changes page - Why?\n- Layout - how could I get paragraph breaks within  one factory? \n- I forked my [[Anthropological Archive]] page from David's why can't I get back to his version?\n - I want to look at and maybe fork the links I've copied down on to my  [[Anthropological Archive]] page but I can't find a way to find them - not even if I put them in my search box (which seems odd as I would have thought forming the original page would bring its links into my neighbourhood collection fro searches).\n- Trying to find other David sites/content to explore and fork from to then add to, but soooo much it is hard to know where to go."
