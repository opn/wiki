The survey was carried out in Jos, a University city about an hour and a half by road from Kafanchan. The survey members, lead by Tayo, spoke to architects, masons, building materials merchants and end users. Of the many interesting suggestions, one respondent suggested that the plastic be used for shoe soles. This had never been considered before and is an exciting idea as shoes have to be particularly hard wearing on the often dry, dusty, uneven paths or where roads are often impassable to vehicles during the rainy season. There was a lot of enthusiasm about the project and a willingness to market the eventual products. "
