      "text": "In a political relationship where power resides will determine how a conflict is resolved or managed. As earlier observed, where there is symmetry of power, there is a balance of power and the conflicting parties can seek to resolve the conflict without one party dictating the terms of settlement. However, where there is asymmetric power relationship there is the tendency of the more powerful to bully the less privileged and cow him or her into submission. Any agreement reached to resolve a conflict in such a situation merely scuttles the problem which may erupt in the future, sometimes violently. "

      "text": "Such issue of asymmetry of power occurred in the relationship between the farmers and Bororo herdsmen when General Sani Abacha was in power. According to Albert (2010), before the Abacha regime, the Fulani and their hosts had agreed on how to settle their differences whenever crops were damaged by the rampaging flocks. However, after General Abacha became head of State in 1993, the Fulani herdsmen reneged on the agreement and stopped paying compensation to farmers. The role of Alhaji Haruna Mai Yasin Katsina, Sarkin Shasha in Ibadan   during the period was instructive. "

The intervention of the Odua People’s Congress (OPC) also contributed to the change in the balance of power between the conflicting parties. Here, it should be pointed out that most of the Bororo Fulanis causing havoc are hirelings temporarily engaged to tend the cattle. The owners of the herds are mostly big time farmers in Northern Nigeria. "
