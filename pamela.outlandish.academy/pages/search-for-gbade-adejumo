      "text": "\"Problem Solving with Pastoralists  in Africa” \nProduced by Pamela McLean Version 2 written April 12th 2017\n\nWe're doing a programme on pastoralists (herdsmen) in Ethiopia and Nigeria, and current challenges to their livelihoods and lifestyles, This is the first of two programmes where academics and African development practitioners come together to share their perspectives.\n\nThe programme is about the future of pastoralism given the challenges of climate change and population growth. In Ethiopia we’re exploring the sustainability of the pastoralists’ way of life and how policy-makers could address the issues. In Nigeria we’re focussing on the current conflicts between pastoralists and farmers, and practical steps being taken on conflict resolution, peace keeping and local solutions. Community radio is playing a role in both situations.\n\nThe people who will be involved in the programmes are Elfneh Bariso, John Dada, and  Chief Gbade Adejumo. They are all respected local figures, with engaging personalities and deep practical knowledge of the situations on the ground. Elfneh is an Ethiopian from a pastoralist community, whose determination gained him an education, leading to a PhD at London University. He lives in London, directs the charity AHEAD (Action for Health, Education and Development) and his current work in Ethiopia includes projects with pastoralists. John Dada has led the work of Fantsuam Foundation, an integrated community development organisation North Central Nigeria, since it was founded in 1996. He lives in South Kaduan and has deep involvement in local pastoralist-farmer issues. Chief Gbade Adejumo lives in Oyo State. He has an extensive knowledge of local issues through a long career has been in local and state government, and community involvement in a voluntary capacity. On his retirement he completed a research degree on Farmer-Pastoralist conflict. \n\nWe will set the scene with a podcast, then we will invite two people from SOAS (staff or students) to join in a studio discussion with Elfneh and John (John will join in via Skype).\n\nWe invite students to join in the discussion in small groups after the broadcast. We will harvest their suggestions, questions, and any action plans they’ve generated, by encouraging them to send in recordings about their discussions, using WhatsApp on their phones. These recordings will inform the shape of the second program, and some of the recordings will be included in it. There will be opportunities to build long term relationships with the projects in Ethiopia and Nigeria should any staff or students wish to do so. \n"
