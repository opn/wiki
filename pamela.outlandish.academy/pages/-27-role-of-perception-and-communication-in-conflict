Perception has been defined as the process by which individuals select, organize, and interpret the input from their senses to give meaning and order to the world around them (Jennifer, 2005).   Perception can be positive or negative and it is negative perception that fuels conflicts. De Haans, (2002) noted that antagonistic perception and beliefs among farmers and herdsmen could compound conflicts especially because of failing traditional institutions. "
