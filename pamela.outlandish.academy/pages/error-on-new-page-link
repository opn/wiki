There is a search box. Somewhere to the right of the search box there you will see the word \"wiki\".  You need the word \"wiki\" to have a tick by it. If it does not have a tick then take your cursor to the word \"wiki\" and click on it so that a tick will be displayed.  (This instruction was correct at at time of writing - June 25th 2017.)"
