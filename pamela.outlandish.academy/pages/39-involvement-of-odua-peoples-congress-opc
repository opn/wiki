The OPC then offered to   intervene and get the Bororos to pay compensation for the crops destroyed. Initially, the Fulanis did not not appreciate the capacity of OPC to deal with them but when they went into confrontation with them and realised that the OPC was a harder nut to crack, they had a rethink. Unlike farmers whom they attacked and  maimed or killed, the OPC were almost invincible. The OPC intervention therefore brought a lot of relief to the farmers."
