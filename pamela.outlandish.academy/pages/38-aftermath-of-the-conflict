      "text": "Many lives were lost on both sides. One unintended consequence of this crisis was the closure of Saki Cattle Market.  Saki community could hardly tolerate any Bororo Fulani in its vicinity. Since it was the Bororo Fulani that supplied the cattle in the Saki kraal, their disappearance from Saki automatically stopped the supply to the market. New cattle markets were opened in Ago Are and Ilesa Ibariba as alternative to the former one at Saki.  The adverse effect of this incident is felt in Saki till today."

According to him, the Okere of Saki, his traditional chiefs and the people were celebrating an annual cultural festival in Okere’s palace when farmers who had just been attacked by Bororo Fulani herdsmen invaded the venue of the event with clear signs and evidence of their assault by the Fulanis. They allegedly recounted many cases of death, rape and robbery."

      "text": "The reaction of those at the venue of the celebration was spontaneous. The hunters, led by Primate Samson Ojoawo, went after the Bororo Fulanis and those found were either killed or maimed. For days, they roamed the bush around Saki villages and any Fulani caught was done in. The Bororo Fulanis on their part, beat a retreat but any Yoruba person whom they met was dealt with viciously. The unfortunate consequence of this conflict was that many innocent persons on both sides lost their lives while many more were injured and their properties either stolen or destroyed."
