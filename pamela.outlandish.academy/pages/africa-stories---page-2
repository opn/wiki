Or if John is invited to join the Nigerian working group on internet freedoms and freedom of information in Abuja, we always ask ourselves the same questions: 'Should I really be here at this event? Or what is the relevance of these frontline, top-level issues to those villagers whose homes have dissolved in the recent floods, or to the patient with the burst appendix who cannot afford to pay for an operation, or to the children whose school has been closed for months because the contractor paid to renovate their classrooms has absconded?' These daily interactions in our communities can easily drown out the outside world."

      "text": "When Fantsuam Foundation began to develop its services in 2001 to meet the development priorities of its host communities, it had no idea that the strategy it was deploying had a name: it is now called ‘integrated development’. Visitors to Fantsuam were often surprised at the array of services provided and some funders even suggested that we prune them down and ‘specialise’. To its credit, it was only Dadamac that saw the logic of our strategy and encouraged us to stick with it, rather than pander to the flavour-of-the-month approach of funding agencies. It was gratifying to discover several years later, that the UN-funded Millenium Villages Project of Jeffery Sacchs (one of the authors of the Millenium Development Goals) had also adopted the integrated development approach."

However Fantsuam went one step ahead of the pack in its early adoption of ICT as a tool in its development. Again Fantsuam worked closely with Dadamac in pursuing this strategy. When the Fantsuam local Cisco Academy faced risk of imminent closure due to its inability to purchase a new set of Cisco bundles, it was Dadamac that looked within its global network and contacted the Cisco Regional office to support our cause."

By exploring affordable and relevant technology options, Fantsuam and Dadamac are able to meet weekly to share information, albeit over mobile and internet connections that are sometimes faulty. The Fantsuam/ Dadamac collaboration shows what ICTs can achieve when harnessed by developing and developed economies. Dadamac located in London keeps Fantsuam abreast of opportunities and resources that it can use for its integrated development programme in a village in northern Nigeria."

Fantsuam’s blogs on the Dadamac website have become a valuable tool which we frequently mention in our funding proposals and reports. It is always encouraging to get feedback through successful grant applications or from people who ask for further information about activities or when blogs trigger new partnerships and expand our network."

He explained how the vision of Attachab had been realised from the combined efforts of all Fantsuam staff and volunteers, past and present, who had taken Fantsuam from its modest origins in Bayan Loco to where it is today, with its grand plans for the future. Although this was a journey of 1,000 steps it was clear that the first steps had been taken. It was just a few more steps in the same direction that the organisation had been taking from its foundation in 1996, that would enable Fantsuam to reach the dream."

Why a fish farm? John’s vision is not just economic development but to ensure that the community – particularly the old, young and more vulnerable – are adequately nourished. Fish are a vital source of protein. Originally the fish farm was based in Bayan Loco and the fish it produced were given to the local community however the unreliable water supply destroyed its viability. However it was the first feature to be recreated at Attachab where, if the gods smile on us, the River Wonderful will ensure a perennial source of water and therefore fat, nutritious fish."

The Foundation’s IT manager Bala staked his future kingdom – as ruler of the ecodome server room. Making the most of local resources for a purpose."

Or if John is invited to join the Nigerian working group on internet freedoms and freedom of information in Abuja, we always ask ourselves the same questions: 'Should I really be here at this event? Or what is the relevance of these frontline, top-level issues to those villagers whose homes have dissolved in the recent floods, or to the patient with the burst appendix who cannot afford to pay for an operation, or to the children whose school has been closed for months because the contractor paid to renovate their classrooms has absconded?' These daily interactions in our communities can easily drown out the outside world."

Visitors to Fantsuam were often surprised at the array of services provided and some funders even suggested that we prune them down and ‘specialise’. To its credit, it was only Dadamac that saw the logic of our strategy and encouraged us to stick with it, rather than pander to the flavour-of-the-month approach of funding agencies. It was gratifying to discover several years later, that the UN-funded Millenium Villages Project of Jeffery Sacchs (one of the authors of the Millenium Development Goals) had also adopted the integrated development approach."

When the Fantsuam local Cisco Academy faced risk of imminent closure due to its inability to purchase a new set of Cisco bundles, it was Dadamac that looked within its global network and contacted the Cisco Regional office to support our cause."

Although this was a journey of 1,000 steps it was clear that the first steps had been taken. It was just a few more steps in the same direction that the organisation had been taking from its foundation in 1996, that would enable Fantsuam to reach the dream."

Why a fish farm? John’s vision is not just economic development but to ensure that the community – particularly the old, young and more vulnerable – are adequately nourished. Fish are a vital source of protein. Originally the fish farm was based in Bayan Loco and the fish it produced were given to the local community however the unreliable water supply destroyed its viability. However it was the first feature to be recreated at Attachab where, if the gods smile on us, the River Wonderful will ensure a perennial source of water and therefore fat, nutritious fish."

The Foundation’s IT manager Bala staked his future kingdom – as ruler of the ecodome server room. Making the most of local resources for a purpose."

Rumours and accusations of diversion of funds split the building committee.. Despite his best efforts, the community town crier was not always able to get enough people along to volunteer to dig pit toilets and grade sand. But, the school, school books, furniture and teachers are ready for the start of the school year...although the new term has now been officially delayed for a week due to the late sighting of the moon for the Sallah (end of Ramadan) celebration... but that’s a different story."
