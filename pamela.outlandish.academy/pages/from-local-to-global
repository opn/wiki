Or if John is invited to join the Nigerian working group on internet freedoms and freedom of information in Abuja, we always ask ourselves the same questions: 'Should I really be here at this event? Or what is the relevance of these frontline, top-level issues to those villagers whose homes have dissolved in the recent floods, or to the patient with the burst appendix who cannot afford to pay for an operation, or to the children whose school has been closed for months because the contractor paid to renovate their classrooms has absconded?' These daily interactions in our communities can easily drown out the outside world."
