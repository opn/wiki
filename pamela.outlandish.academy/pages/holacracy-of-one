(This purpose of the Co-Intelligence Catalyst role of mine is presently also under exploration as the proposed explicit mission of Enlivening Edge.)\nThe role’s accountabilities can be memorized with a new meaning of the familiar acronym, HTML, which in this case, stands for:\n- Humans — supporting people who know that none of us is smart as all of us, and want to graduate from communities of learners to communities that learn.\n- Tools — advising the creation of maps and platforms of transformational movements and post-conventional educational offers, including their Community Knowledge.\n- Methods — contributing to the development of, and sharing the fruits of, new approaches to augment CI.\n- Learning — inspiring the formation of communities of CI-boosting practice, where practitioners can become ever better at their art, thanks to the mutual exposure to each other’s mental models and practices.\n"

They alternate who is leading, cuddling and clinging with entwined limbs, in good days, knowing that they can get far away from each other only at their own peril. That dance floor is the domain of the Praxis Researcher.\nMy work as a researcher is the work of a basket weaver. My “craft” and purpose is to weave a basket of deep understanding of how the evolution of consciousness and society work and affect each other, and then to share it with all who are inspired to foster that evolution. In that role, I want to dive for ever-deeper truths in the overlap of science, spirituality, technology, and social change.\nThe accountabilities of this role include:\n- Conducting participatory action research (PAR) into the future of work and organizing\n- Developing scalable PAR methodologies suitable to cause the resolution of wicked challenges in organizations and social systems\n- Contributing to the further development of the PAR field, through writing and publishing, and through cultivating epistemic communities\n"

Oxford University Press)\nThere are names that try to describe that space, like Wholeness, Emptiness, Non-duality, Oneness, the Source, the Light, and more (including the Force, for Star Wars fans.) They all reflect an aspect of the unspeakable quality, but when a name is given, its living, multidimensional nature is reduced to a concept.

        "text": "**West** — CO-INTELLIGENCE CATALYST (Co-evolution Fostering)\nThe domain here is the emergent collective intelligence (CI) of groups, organizations, cities, and other complex adaptive social systems. Here, I define CI as the capacity of human communities to evolve towards higher-order complexity and harmony, through such innovation mechanisms as variation-feedback-selection, differentiation-integration-transformation, and competition-cooperation-“coopetition”.\nThe role’s purpose is boosting the emergent collective intelligence, consciousness, and impact of the ecosystem of next-stage organizations and initiatives until they become the new mainstream of organizing work. (This purpose of the Co-Intelligence Catalyst role of mine is presently also under exploration as the proposed explicit mission of Enlivening Edge.)\nThe role’s accountabilities can be memorized with a new meaning of the familiar acronym, HTML, which in this case, stands for:\n- Humans — supporting people who know that none of us is smart as all of us, and want to graduate from communities of learners to communities that learn.\n- Tools — advising the creation of maps and platforms of transformational movements and post-conventional educational offers, including their Community Knowledge.\n- Methods — contributing to the development of, and sharing the fruits of, new approaches to augment CI.\n- Learning — inspiring the formation of communities of CI-boosting practice, where practitioners can become ever better at their art, thanks to the mutual exposure to each other’s mental models and practices.\n"

        "text": "**North** — PRAXIS RESEARCHER (Knowledge Development)\nPraxis is the name of the dance floor where Mr. Theory and Ms. Practice caper together. They alternate who is leading, cuddling and clinging with entwined limbs, in good days, knowing that they can get far away from each other only at their own peril. That dance floor is the domain of the Praxis Researcher.\nMy work as a researcher is the work of a basket weaver. My “craft” and purpose is to weave a basket of deep understanding of how the evolution of consciousness and society work and affect each other, and then to share it with all who are inspired to foster that evolution. In that role, I want to dive for ever-deeper truths in the overlap of science, spirituality, technology, and social change.\nThe accountabilities of this role include:\n- Conducting participatory action research (PAR) into the future of work and organizing\n- Developing scalable PAR methodologies suitable to cause the resolution of wicked challenges in organizations and social systems\n- Contributing to the further development of the PAR field, through writing and publishing, and through cultivating epistemic communities\n"

Oxford University Press)\nThere are names that try to describe that space, like Wholeness, Emptiness, Non-duality, Oneness, the Source, the Light, and more (including the Force, for Star Wars fans.) They all reflect an aspect of the unspeakable quality, but when a name is given, its living, multidimensional nature is reduced to a concept. I hold it as the evolutionary impulse manifesting in/through/as me, as well as in/through/as all of us.\n"
