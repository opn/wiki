Some are nomadic, semi-settled (transhumant) and settled (sedentary agro pastoralists) according to the degree of mobility (Oladele and Oladele 2011). Albert (2012:105) categorized the Fulanis in Oke Ogun into four. The first is the Fulani Yorubas or the “Fulani Ile” i.e Fulanis who were born and bred in Oke Ogun or whose parents were born in Oke Ogun and they speak Yoruba and Fulfude languages fluently. The second type is the settled Fulani who have chosen to live in Oke Ogun and move their herds around the area in search of pasture. It was revealed that those familiar with Oke Ogun move their herds about carefully, without destroying crops and in the event of any destruction, willingly settle with the   farmers."

They settle in one place for some time and later move,   especially in the dry season, in search of pasture .It is said that these group are also easier to relate with should their herds destroy farms. The last and the most dreaded are the ones called the Bororos who are young Fulanis hired to herd animals belonging to wealthy and influential people in Northern Nigeria. These are the ones that drive their herds into farms, destroying them with impunity. Since they carry dangerous weapons including guns, they attack the farmers and can maim or kill. Anyone who challenges them risks being assaulted or killed. Unverifiable information often allege that they partake in robberies either on the highways or in the bush and some times, maim or kill victims. "
