This brings them into direct conflict with farmers and other resource users. Besides, modern States were created in such a way to restrict nomads to fixed and artificial boundaries, thereby making people who are historically mobile new prisoners of limited spaces. This situation increases their vulnerability to the vagaries of social and natural scarcities. This, according to a school of thought, is the fundamental source of conflict between farmers and herdsmen (Shettima and Tar, 2008)."
