Many people think or believe that just because we were taken from our parents at such a young age we suffered and maybe emotionally to some degree it might be so, but our childhood were filled with literally everything a child could ask for, we never lacked for anything. And I think for many kids this was a better childhood than having grown up in a refugee camp in Angola or Zambia.\n \n"
