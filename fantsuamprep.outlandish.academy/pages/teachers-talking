It is recognised that most of the course participants have few books in their schools, no electricity, and therefor little chance of using a computer in their classrooms. However their pupils need to know about computers, and be ready to use them if ever the chance presents itself. This is not just a matter of operating a computer, but of having a wider vision for the potential of digital technology, both for information processing and for communication."

It is possible that they may not get a chance to use one again, unless they visit an urban centre where there may be a cyber cafe. This means that if they do use a computer after TT they can probably expect to seek help from cyber cafe staff, but it helps if they have some idea of what they might try to do. Even if they don't ever use a computer after TT, they will teach more confidently about computers if they have had practical experience during the course."
