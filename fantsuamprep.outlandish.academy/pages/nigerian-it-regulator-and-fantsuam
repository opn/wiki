This point was brought home to the audience by the CEO of The Business People, Jummai Umar-Ajijola (PhD) when she observed that there needs to be sustained support for NGOs that are engaged in IT development and deployment in Nigeria, to encourage more civil society engagement."

The Fantsuam Foundation Knowledge Resource Centre (KRC) is evidence of the potential in rural Nigeria, when facilities are provided. The KRC had its seed funding from Microsoft, and with technical support from Dadamac-UK it has grown to be the hub of development for the organization. The Fantsuam ZittNet Academy is another example of an integrated rural connectivity solution with its hybrid back-up power and use of low power computers to provide internet access and computer literacy programs to underserved rural communities."
