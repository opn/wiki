Gradually we explored ideas, and pulled more people into the development team, learning as we went along. In typical Dadmac fashion, we were working at a distance. The People'sUni.org proof of concept can be seen as an example of online \"project based learning\" for the development team. Unusually for project based learning all of our participants already had some kind of professional qualification and two of our \"learning by doing\" participants (John and Dick) were retired professors."

When I have no better way to describe what I do in Dadamac I fall back on the fact that I'm a life-long-learner and say that I'm a student. It's a label with many advantages, including allowing me to be someone who is thinking and seeking knowledge. Being a student also makes it acceptable if I fund my Dadamac role through unrelated day-jobs."

Dadamac provided him with a location to build a small demonstration ecodome at Attachab (near to Fantsuam) and we provided a team of people to work with him. We gave him all the local knowledge he needed to plan his trip, and to help him during his visit.

I've had to write more than I anticipated, so I hope it will get read nonetheless. I hope that now someone from outside can look at it all of Dadamac with fresh eyes. I hope this is a first step towards finding a mentor who will help me to recognise what is of value in Dadamac,. Then I hope we can organise it in an effective and sustainable way, so that it can be useful and fit for purpose in our 21st century, rapidly changing world."

For example, when Professor Dick Heller shared with me his dream of using his time in retirement to share his expertise with people in low income countries we had no plan for how this might happen. Gradually we explored ideas, and pulled more people into the development team, learning as we went along. In typical Dadmac fashion, we were working at a distance. The People'sUni.org proof of concept can be seen as an example of online \"project based learning\" for the development team. Unusually for project based learning all of our participants already had some kind of professional qualification and two of our \"learning by doing\" participants (John and Dick) were retired professors."

When I have no better way to describe what I do in Dadamac I fall back on the fact that I'm a life-long-learner and say that I'm a student. It's a label with many advantages, including allowing me to be someone who is thinking and seeking knowledge. Being a student also makes it acceptable if I fund my Dadamac role through unrelated day-jobs."

It was easy to see that top-down ways were inevitable back when two-way communication between UK and rural Africa was slow and/or expensive or even impossible, but I was shocked at how many projects were still top-down and disconnected from reality on the ground. We wanted to help change things and thought Dadamac Limited would provide a sustainable way to do so."
