When the ‘Growing Businesses Foundation’ asked if Fantsuam would be its partner in introducing a pilot Mobile Money scheme to rural women, it was an appealing idea. Fantsuam’s experience of cash transactions in its microfinance service shows that cash has serious security lapses. In contrast, Fantsuam is aware of the easy uptake of Mobile Money transactions in Kenya and Uganda."
