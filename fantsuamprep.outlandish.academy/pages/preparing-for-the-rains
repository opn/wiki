At the meeting on Tuesday he told us that they were unable to get buy the 8 week old fish they had planned but have purchased 2,000 4 week old fingerlings which will be reared and harvested in the earth ponds. But earth ponds are no use when the rains start as they will get clogged up and overflow, and the fish will be lost into the River Wonderful which flows past the Attachab land. For the rainy season they will need to get the  concrete ponds ready for use."

At the moment it is very hot but people are making preparations  for the start of the rainy season. The fast tractor is being used to plough the land so that it will be ready for planting. Seed is sown when the rains are due to arrive. This is a worrying  time for everyone. If the rains come late then the seed will be burned by the sun and more seed will have to be obtained. If the rains are too heavy when they first arrive then the seed will be washed away. Rain fall is very localised and people watch anxiously as dark clouds pass by overhead wondering if the rain will fall on their land or their neighbours."
