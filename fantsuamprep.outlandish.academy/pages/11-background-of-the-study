In the first place, land was available in large quantity; hence pastoralists and farmers could pursue their occupation with minimum conflict.  Secondly, the population was relatively small and subsistent farming was in vogue. There was also a symbiotic relationship between farmers and herdsmen as farmers interested in livestock would keep their cattle with the pastoralists. When the pastoralists moved round in search of pasture in the dry season, they ensured that they drove through the farmers’ holdings after the latter had harvested their crops."

The Yorubas (and indeed Nigerians) obtain their meat supply from beef while the Fulanis depend on Yoruba farmers for grains which is their staple food.  Therefore, there has been a very strong economic, nutritional and symbiotic relationship between farmers and pastoralists. With this kind of interdependence, there ought not to be conflict between the Fulanis and the Yorubas, their host.
