Since such resources are inadequate for the need of all, there is competition for their usage and this can sometimes be fierce and destructive. A case in point is the competition for land between farmers and herdsman (pastoralists). Furthermore, imaginary consequences of a proposed action of a party or another can also lead to conflicts. A typical example is Sudan’s objection to Ethiopia’s plan to construct a hydro–electric dam on the Blue Nile.

      "text": "(ii) Manipulation of information:  Information can be manipulated to generate peace or create conflict. People who have control over information collection and dissemination play a crucial role in its manipulation. Officially described as propaganda, information can be deployed to achieve either positive or negative ends. The effect of information manipulation in escalating the Rwanda genocide of 1994 is a typical example of how information dissemination can have catastrophic effects. A radio station goaded Hutus into killing Tutsis and moderate Hutus who were described as cockroaches. Even during Nigeria’s Civil War of 1966-70, information was manipulated on the radio which led to the killing of thousands of Igbos in the North. These are clear examples of how manipulation of information can have disastrous consequences."
