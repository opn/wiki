Blench (2005;iv-16) puts this succinctly when he observes that if the Nigerian population is projected backwards to pre-colonial times, the human population, for what is today known as Nigeria,  may not be more than 10 million in the19th and early 20th century. Conversely, the land area of the Nigerian nation remains unchanged. If comparison is done between then and now,  the present population of 140 million (2006 population and housing census) poses greater stress and tension to the relationship of farmers and herders as the land area under cultivation in the earlier period would have been far less extensive than now. Hence, pastoralists and farmers at that time related with little or no friction."
