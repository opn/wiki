A good example is the private initiative of Intel Corporation which late last year launched a unique first of its kind telemedicine initiative in the country that will transform health care delivery to rural areas and ensure that rural folks get the best quality healthcare no matter the distance."

A good example is the private initiative of Intel Corporation which late last year launched a unique first of its kind telemedicine initiative in the country that will transform health care delivery to rural areas and ensure that rural folks get the best quality healthcare no matter the distance."
