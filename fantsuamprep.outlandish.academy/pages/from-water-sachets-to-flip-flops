There were few plastic bags and the fruit and veg and even the eggs were sold loose. Shoppers took their own empty bottle if they wanted to buy groundnut oil for cooking. In Nigeria plastic bags have become more common but in addition drinking water is sold in individual plastic sachets. These are useful for those who are travelling or to help people through their school or working day if there is no other drinking water available. In the UK and elsewhere we have become more aware of the environmental damage caused by waste plastic. in addition, in Nigeria the discarded water sachets can clog the drains and cause flooding."

Marcus, who had worked on another project with Fantsuam, was able to bring back some plastic waste to the UK and Ron and his students manufactured a sample tile. Comic Relief had funded a feasibility study and Linus, an engineer, went to the UK from Nigeria to work with Ron and his team on the possibilities of converting this plastic waste to something useful."
