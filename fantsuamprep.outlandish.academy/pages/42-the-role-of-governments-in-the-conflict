      "text": "Historically, government at the State and Local Governments have played active roles in managing the conflicts between farmers and Fulani herdsmen in Oyo State in general and in Saki West Local Government areas in particular. The famed intervention of the former Governor of Oyo State, late Alhaji Lam Adesina is a case in point. On 22nd May, 2000 he called a peace meeting between Yorubas and Bororo Fulanis herdsmen during which he read a “riot act” to Local Government Council Executive Officers and threatened that he would dissolve any Local Government Caretaker Committee where communal disturbance between Fulani herdsmen and Farmers occurred."
