The Local Government is bounded on the East by Saki-East Focal Government, on the South by Atisbo Local Government and on the West by the Republic of Benin. It is bounded on the North by Baruteen Local Government of Kwara State. Saki-West Local Government area has a population of 278,002 (2006 census). The headquarters of the Local Government is Saki, a prominent commercial and farming centre. Due to its strategic location, the town attracts people from all parts of the country and West Africa, especially the francophone countries. It is also a major town on the main North-west/South-west cattle route, hence the occurrence of conflicts between farmers and pastoralists in the Local Government area.  "
