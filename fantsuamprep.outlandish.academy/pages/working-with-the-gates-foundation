High levels of aflatoxin in these staple crops poses serious health hazards in humans and live stock in addition to the major loss in farmers' income. Aflatoxin contamination of Nigeria's staple crops is  well researched but it is only recently that the political and financial resources required to implement aggressive preventive measures have been mobilised."
