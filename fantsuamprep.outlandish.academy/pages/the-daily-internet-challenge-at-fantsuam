Air-time on the internet via a smart phone is limited due to the high cost paid to the mobile phone company and the batteries also frequently need recharging. It is quite a chore to try and submit a proposal for funding on the small screen of a smart phone and it is difficult to down load attachments. Completing forms online and meeting deadlines is an almost impossible challenge. Browsing on the internet to find new information and new opportunities for funding is a luxury out of reach of Fantsuam. And to make matters worse, the weather is so hot at the moment!"
