Furthermore, it is a well-known fact that perception plays a major role in conflict generation and management. What are the perceptual filters that govern the relationship?  Perceptual filters include culture, ethnicity, gender and sexuality, knowledge, previous experiences in managing the conflicts, i.e. issues that may condition the attitudes of the parties to the present conflict (Tung –Tooney 1994). For instance, how much respect does an average Yoruba have for a Bororo Fulani and vice-versa?"
