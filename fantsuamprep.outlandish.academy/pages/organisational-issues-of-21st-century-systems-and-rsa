I was intrigued by the similarities and differences between the different models. They were all very different and yet each expressed the same very simple emerging truths. In each case the established RSA was represented as a formal, organised structure (lots of lego there). The network was chaotic, flexible and organic (lots of plasticine). The two systems (the established RSA and the network) looked like different worlds, existing side by side, but initially not connected in any way."

It is comparatively easy for people who are involved in a new, evolving and largely invisible network to look at an older visible well established structure (one they may even have experienced for themselves - or something like it). It is not hard to make reasonably well informed judgements about it."

The cliffs are fixed and, also, they are easily visible from the sea long before the boats can be seen from the shore.
