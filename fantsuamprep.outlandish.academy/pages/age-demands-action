Mercy, Fantsuam’s communications officer, was fully occupied in making all the logistical arrangements including providing transport and lunch to make the day a success. The theme for this year’s World Health day was vector borne diseases and the Kakas learned about two diseases which were particularly relevant to their community - malaria and river blindness. The Government needs to be aware of the needs of the elderly when considering measures to address these diseases."

As a follow-up it it was agreed that a letter should be written to the Nigerian Labour Congress to push this agenda forward. Fantsuam recommends, among other things, that there should be designated care for the elderly in government hospitals and nurses should be given appropriate training in this field. The elderly should not have to join the regular queue at the hospital but be given priority because of their age and frailty."
