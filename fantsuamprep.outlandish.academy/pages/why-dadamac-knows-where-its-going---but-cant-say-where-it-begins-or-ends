(I was initially horrified to find that some meetings were arranged during my visit simply because it helped my friends if they took along someone with a white skin, but it was a fact of life at the time. We didn't have much in the way of money, so we had to make the most of whatever resources we did have.)  Most importantly, I'd learn all kinds of things, and come back with a better idea of how to be helpful at a distance."

(I was initially horrified to find that some meetings were arranged during my visit simply because it helped my friends if they took along someone with a white skin, but it was a fact of life at the time. We didn't have much in the way of money, so we had to make the most of whatever resources we did have.)  Most importantly, I'd learn all kinds of things, and come back with a better idea of how to be helpful at a distance."

By 2030 I hope those visions will be fully realised and accepted as the norm in UK-Africa collaborations. I have a big vision for 2030 - but that is some time ahead and, as I get older, I will  step aside. Meanwhile I am fully energised to take Dadamac to its next level."
