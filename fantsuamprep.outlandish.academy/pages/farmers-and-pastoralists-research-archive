The Savory Institute informs policymakers and stakeholders of the need to shift current agriculture and land management policies and programs.\n\n- *Identifying and Establishing Market Incentives*\nThe Savory Institute works to identify and establish strategies to create market-based incentives to encourage managing holistically to create environmental, economic and social benefits.\n\n- *Monitoring, Curating, and Coordinating Research*\nThe Savory Institute coordinates and supports comprehensive social, ecological, and financial monitoring and relevant research. We work in collaboration with organizations, scientists, and academic institutions to collect and conduct research that will increase our understanding of how properly managed livestock in the grasslands of the world and managing holistically contribute to increasing biological diversity, increasing soil carbon, and addressing problems such as drought, poverty, hunger, and social violence.\n\n- *Increasing Public Awareness*\nThe Savory Institute engages many different audiences to change public perception that livestock itself causes the degradation of grasslands. It is actually the way humans manage livestock that is the culprit. This fundamental shift in thinking must happen to drive needed policy and market shifts. Many different key environmental activists and thought leaders are supporting our efforts to increase public awareness such as TED, HRH Prince of Wales, Deepak Chopra, Ian Somerhalder, Hazel Henderson, Gretel Erlich, and Peter Byck among others."
