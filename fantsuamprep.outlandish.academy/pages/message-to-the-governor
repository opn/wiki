Age Demands Action (ADA) was launched in 2007 in 27 countries and it has rapidly grown in 62 countries where it helps to challenge age discrimination and fight for the rights of older people. Older people are at the heart of ADA since they are best suited to become activists on ageing issues and are passionate advocates for change in their communities."

These vulnerable groups had no shelter, food, medical assistance and physical protection. The consensus at the Kafanchan ADA meeting was that there is a need to ask the Kaduna State Government to provide clarity about the Government’s responsibilities to protect older people’s rights, taking into account the fact that over 80% of older persons were not ex-civil servants and therefore they do not receive any pension from Government."
