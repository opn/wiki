John, who is part of a sub-theme group for rural development and deployment, attended a meeting last week and was asked to assist some other states to develop their own ICT policy appropriate to their local situation. Consequently John is travelling this week and next to Oshun state and Niger state to help others with their ICT development. I reported a a few weeks back that with Fantsuam's enterprise and generous donors like the Canadian Government Fantsuam's ICT facilities in a rural community are better than some educational institutions.Hopefully Fantsuam's expertise and commitment will be passed to others."

There are no state social care services so the elderly are dependent on families and neighbours. Many families, particularly women give heroic care to relatives who may have long term conditions like Parkinsons disease, diabetes or dementia and  sometimes need to provide daily nursing care. Recently Fantsuam heard about a older woman whose difficulties were compounded by her overweight who had no-one to assist her in having a shower. It was arranged that she should come to the Fantsuam Health Centre at the weekend when the place was quiet and she could take be helped to take a 'shower' in privacy with a bucket of water and a scoop. She was so grateful for the help with this basic but essential need. Fantsuam has also for a long time supported grandmothers, Kakas in Hausa, who care for their grandchildren, orphaned by AIDS."
