But I had not reckoned on coping with the ICT challenge of keeping apace with my class and courses; a reliable internet connection was one of the requirements of getting on this course and I had been given assurances that our VSAT would be adequate for my needs."

It has taken me two weeks to download these articles due to poor connectivity and unreliable grid. And now as I settle down to savour the contents of these precious journal articles, I have a niggling worry at the back of my mind: will there be internet access and sufficient grid power for me to submit my assignments once I have finished with them? I guess I should wait until I get to that bridge before worrying about it. But it will be nice to be able to submit my assignments on time just like everybody else in my class...."
