I could see that ICT could bridge that gap. After all, the Internet has been an important link in the chain between my contacts (in rural Nigeria) and me (in the UK) since Peter's death in 2000. I am convinced that the Internet  should be enabling a similar two-way-communication relationship between the International Development Establishment and grass-roots projects."

I'm delighted that we're now seriously exploring areas for collaboration."
