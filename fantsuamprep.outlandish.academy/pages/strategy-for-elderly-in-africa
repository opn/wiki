SCCF hosted a national workshop in Abeokuta, on Wednesday 9th July 2014. In attendance were the State Governors of Osun, Ekiti and Edo, several senior citizens and also members of the Nigerian Society for Geriatrics and Gerontology. Alongside his Excellency Prince Bola Ajibola, Dr Fayemi of Ekiti State and Bishop Matthew Kukah of the Sokoto Catholic Diocese, John Dada from Fantsuam was on the panel of speakers. The workshop observed that for the past thirty-two years, Nigeria has been making efforts, locally and internationally to develop a comprehensive policy for the care of its senior citizens but there has not been much appreciable progress."

The central bank has confirmed that, next to oil, the elderly are the highest income earners in Nigeria through the remittances sent from their children abroad. But this only applies to only a small segment of the elderly population. For the rest it is worrying that there is no universal pension and entitlement for the elderly. This lack of provision for old age may be a contributory factor to the high level of corruption and mismanagement of Government resources as individuals try to maximise whatever they can for their old age. In addition, due to the scourge of HIV/AIDS, many elderly parents are now carers of their grandchildren."
