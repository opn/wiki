It evolved from a previous UK-registered charity (CAWD)  which had served its purpose and was about to be wound up by the trustees (including Pamela McLean). Nikki Fishman, who was active in Dadamac at the time (around 2007), recognised the overlapping purpose between CAWD and the work of Dadamac, and under her direction it was renamed and re-energised in support of appropriate Dadamac initiatives.

      "text": "#The \"wealth\" of Dadamac Foundation\nDadamac Foundation is founded on the wealth of information available through the Dadamac network, and the desire of people in that network to support each other. It has yet to find an official fundraiser, so it tends to \"tick away in the background\", as a formal organisation, with low overheads, able to leap into life when it is needed. In financial terms its most impressive work was when Dadamac Foundation provided the umbrella organisation for an urgent fundraising initiative called \"Fast Tractor\". Currently (August 2017) the Dadamac Foundation volunteers are most concerned with information, with raising the profile of work done in Africa by people in the Dadamac network (people known as \"Dadamac Changemakers\") and providing the changemakers with other information-related support. We welcome additional volunteers including fundraisers, to extend our work and build on its foundations."
