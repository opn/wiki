Furthermore, the outcomes of non-violent resource conflict may include institutional rules which define categories of inclusion and exclusion to natural resources. It may also lead to migratory avoidance strategies whereby herders keep away from zones of intense competition with farmers. It could also involve collaborative efforts between farmers, to check resource exploitation by external actors. The actors may even decide to diversify into multiple sources of livelihood. In Borno State, for example, farmers move, in preference, from some particular crops to others. Farmers in Bama Local Government Area of the State were said to have stopped cultivating tomatoes (Shettima and Tar, 2008). "

Such activities include the burning of fossil fuel which emits harmful gases into the atmosphere and consequently depletes the ozone layer. The resultant effect is global warming, flooding in many countries and persistent droughts in others. Off season rains and dry spells were said to have sent crop growing seasons out of orbit (Odoh and Chilaka, 2012; p114)."
