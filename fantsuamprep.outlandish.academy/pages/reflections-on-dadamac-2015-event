There are many more people, organisations and locations we'd like to include. We connect with other projects in English speaking sub-Saharan Africa directly through the Dadamac network. We connect indirectly with a wider group through Kabissa - Space for Change in Africa and through the newly formed RSA UK-Africa Network.

I rashly relied on the video recordings to tell me all the details, not realising that the camera batteries were running low, so only the start of what people said was recorded. The stick mics had also let us down so the sound was not all it might be. I'll try to invite everyone to send me details of what they said in their introductions, so that we have that information available to share."

There are many more people, organisations and locations we'd like to include. We connect with other projects in English speaking sub-Saharan Africa directly through the Dadamac network. We connect indirectly with a wider group through Kabissa - Space for Change in Africa and through the newly formed RSA UK-Africa Network.

As John predicted in his fable of the blind men, there are many different perspectives. Some perhaps seem contradictory, but all reflecting truths from different viewpoints. I anticipate that they will all make complete sense as time passes and we learn from each other and come to understand each others' perspectives."

I'm happy to continue with my voluntary work, as long as I'm not working alone. We have several people willing to give us some of their time and skills in 2015. We also have a suggestion for finding funding, and we have one regular donor committed to giving us £10 a month. We have no other regular income or support. The future of our work genuinely depends on what comes out of the January 2015 event."
