As aptly put by Albert (2010), the violence between herders and farmers is not ethnic but a “war” between farmers whose interest is to protect their farms and Fulani herdsmen who would not mind if their cattle destroyed farms. Their only concern is the survival of their herds and they can pursue this to any length."

In the Sahel region, for instance, incidences of violent conflicts between crop and livestock farmers in 1988 and 1995 were reported in the south-west region of Burkina Faso.   Fulani herdsmen migrated from the dry northern and western parts to the south of the country in search of good grazing land and in the process, got into conflict with Karaboro farmers whose farms were invaded and destroyed. The confrontations, as usual, turned violent and this resulted in killing and maiming on both sides (Emmanuel Salliot; Sahel &West Africa Club OECD 50, 2010)."
