At the heart of pastoralist versus farmers’ conflict is the changing pattern of pastoral movement from the late 19th century onwards. It is generally assumed that Fulbes (ie Fulanis) first arrived as nomads in the far north between 14th and 16th century. Attempts to move further south was checkmated by the incidence of animal diseases. Gallery forests along river banks which created an ideal breeding place for tsetse flies further discouraged southward movement (Blench and Dendo, 2004)."

This is because before the disappearance of cattle tracks, there were routes which the herdsmen followed and if they defaulted in its usage, they could, at least, be put back on track and this minimized contact and the possibility of conflict between them and farmers. With many of the cattle tracks now turned to farms, friction frequently occur between the two parties.    "

The intra and interstate conflicts in Nigeria and West Africa aided illegal access to light weapons by the people. This problem of illegal access to weapons may have begun from the time of Nigeria/Biafra war of 1967 to 1970 .Since then, there have been fratricidal conflicts in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Cote D’voire etc. and dangerous weapons have been circulating virtually unhindered within the sub-region. This is a major cause of insecurity in the area. Nowadays, many Bororo Fulani herdsmen are said to carry sophisticated weapons like AK 47 guns which most probably were illegally acquired. The farmers of Saki West affirmed that many herdsmen are usually armed with dangerous weapons and this gives them the temerity to   enter farms and destroy crops with impunity. It was also alleged that the Bororo Fulanis got away with heinous crimes like robbery, murder, and rape in the area because of the sophisticated arms they carry. "

In pre-colonial times, there were no legal boundaries among nation states, hence pastoralists moved freely and crossed borders in search of pasture. As Lattimore (1940;1962)  pointed  out, pastoral nomads are driven by the “sovereign importance of movement” and boundaries and territories have never had any meaning to them.  However, colonial masters created artificial boundaries which, in some cases, split ethnic groups into different countries. This situation compounded the problem of pastoralists."

        "text": "(c) Collapse of the system of cattle tracks (also known as burti).This, according to Blench and Dendo, was the most important cause of conflicts between farmers and herdsmen. This is because before the disappearance of cattle tracks, there were routes which the herdsmen followed and if they defaulted in its usage, they could, at least, be put back on track and this minimized contact and the possibility of conflict between them and farmers. With many of the cattle tracks now turned to farms, friction frequently occur between the two parties.    "

        "text": "(d) Widespread availability of light weapons and general insecurity in Nigeria and in the West African sub- region. The intra and interstate conflicts in Nigeria and West Africa aided illegal access to light weapons by the people. This problem of illegal access to weapons may have begun from the time of Nigeria/Biafra war of 1967 to 1970 .Since then, there have been fratricidal conflicts in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Cote D’voire etc. and dangerous weapons have been circulating virtually unhindered within the sub-region. This is a major cause of insecurity in the area. Nowadays, many Bororo Fulani herdsmen are said to carry sophisticated weapons like AK 47 guns which most probably were illegally acquired. The farmers of Saki West affirmed that many herdsmen are usually armed with dangerous weapons and this gives them the temerity to   enter farms and destroy crops with impunity. It was also alleged that the Bororo Fulanis got away with heinous crimes like robbery, murder, and rape in the area because of the sophisticated arms they carry. "

As pointed out above, animal health-care  facilitated by significant developments in modern veterinary medicine now makes it possible for individuals to own larger stocks of cattle hence, the need for larger grazing areas but the  reality is that the herders are confronted  with dwindling areas of pasture.

        "text": "(f) Greater internationalization of migration with pastoralists from neighbouring countries making long range movements to other countries for lush green pasture. In pre-colonial times, there were no legal boundaries among nation states, hence pastoralists moved freely and crossed borders in search of pasture. As Lattimore (1940;1962)  pointed  out, pastoral nomads are driven by the “sovereign importance of movement” and boundaries and territories have never had any meaning to them.  However, colonial masters created artificial boundaries which, in some cases, split ethnic groups into different countries. This situation compounded the problem of pastoralists."
