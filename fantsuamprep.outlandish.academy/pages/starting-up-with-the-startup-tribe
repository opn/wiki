She built its \"social capital\" (i.e. her contacts, credibility, knowledge and networks) and she'd done \"proof of concept\", and attracted some money and other resources, but not quickly enough to declare it sustainable. Unlike me, she still has family responsibilities, so she had to find a \"proper part-time paid job\" as well. Recently she reluctantly decided it was best to park Collage Network for the time being and we've been able to catchup with each other again."
