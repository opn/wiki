Visitors to Fantsuam were often surprised at the array of services provided and some funders even suggested that we prune them down and ‘specialise’. To its credit, it was only Dadamac that saw the logic of our strategy and encouraged us to stick with it, rather than pander to the flavour-of-the-month approach of funding agencies. It was gratifying to discover several years later, that the UN-funded Millenium Villages Project of Jeffery Sacchs (one of the authors of the Millenium Development Goals) had also adopted the integrated development approach."

When the Fantsuam local Cisco Academy faced risk of imminent closure due to its inability to purchase a new set of Cisco bundles, it was Dadamac that looked within its global network and contacted the Cisco Regional office to support our cause."

The Fantsuam/ Dadamac collaboration shows what ICTs can achieve when harnessed by developing and developed economies.
