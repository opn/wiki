During the visit, he went beyond just checking on his protégés and ran one full day of patient consultation and a second full day of theatre operations in Fantsuam's small rural health centre. He saw patients with the usual range of ailments and in one day operated on seven of them: hernia repairs, polyp excision etc. One of the patients needed to have a chest X-ray, but could not afford it. Awojobi paid for the patient to have her X-ray done. For three other patients for whom he needed more resources than were available in the rudimentary provisions of the Fantsuam operating theatre, he has offered free surgery at his clinic in Eruwa. One such patient was a 3 year old; her parents could not withhold their tears of gratitude at such magnanimity. Dr. Awojobi must be the first specialist Nigerian surgeon to visit Kafanchan in recent memory and to offer his services for free."

Apart from ensuring adequate water supply to the theatre, FRHC needs to engage a medical doctor who shares its passion for rural healthcare. Awojobi has offered a free, intensive 3-months training for such a doctor at Awojobi Clinics Eruwa (ACE). The lucky doctor will be given all the training s/he needs to perform routine and emergency surgical procedures at an affordable cost to the people of Kafanchan. With such a doctor in place, supported by the existing healthcare workers who will receive continuing professional education from ACE, there will be closer monitoring and mentoring of the FHRC, to ensure that ACE standards are faithfully replicated."
