Forty-eight of them attended an event organised by Fantsuam Foundation as its contribution to World Health Day celebrated on Sunday 7th April. The Kakas were given the opportunity to have their blood pressure checked by a local nurse and for those already suffering from health problems, to receive treatment for malaria and typhoid."

She had also made drinks of zobo, from the sepals of the sorrel plant, to provide what is described as a fruity and fragrant drink with a deep purple colour. The drink is not only attractive and made from locally available plants but also helpful in dealing with the problem of hypertension, in a village area which has a burden of people with strokes. At the end of the day one of the Kakas proposed a vote of thanks and a report and pictures were sent to HelpAged International."
