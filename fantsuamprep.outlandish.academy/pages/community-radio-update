Efforts to get more traction into the advocacy efforts have been quite challenging, with a chequered history and sometimes it is not too clear what progress has been made. However the need for this ‘Voice of the People’ continues to grow within development and civil society circles. Fantsuam Foundation felt so optimistic about the Nigerian Government’s future approval of community radio licences that it began human capacity building and equipment mobilization in 2008."
