The Governor’s meeting with a powerful delegation of Fulani cattle owners from Northern Nigeria under the leadership of General Mohammadu Buhari discussed above was another instance of his intervention.

The State Government has also established cattle routes (annexure-v) which, if properly utilized and manned, is likely to minimize conflicts between farmers and Fulanis in the State."

It is an established fact that when farmers take cases of Bororo herdsmen destroying their farms to the police for intervention, the Fulanis often allegedly bribe their way and go scot free. The complainant could end up being threatened with prosecution if he “failed to cooperate.”  "

Unlike the police with whom the Fulanis had established some kind of rapport, a high court judge is virtually inaccessible. The Fulanis are said to be afraid of appearing before such a judge and are, therefore, prepared to negotiate settlement with the farmers through their lawyers.  The legal practitioner stated that many cases have been settled through this method. He was also of the opinion that this approach could have some deterrent effect as a Bororo herdsman who knows that if he destroys a farmer’s farm may end up paying substantial compensation may be wary of such act of destruction. Whether this approach would stand the test of time remains to be seen. "

The meetings were arranged following increasing cases of confrontation between farmers and Bororo Fulanis. In effect, it was some sort of early warning system to forestall the possibility of violence erupting in the area. "

The Sarikis were made to give undertakings that such destruction would stop but where they occurred again, the Sarikis would be held responsible. It was also decided that except in cases involving death or injury, cases of misunderstanding should be resolved at the local level.  This joint- problem solving approach by the stakeholders, if given the chance to succeed, would, hopefully, minimise the rancour and bloodletting which occur periodically in the area."

The Governor’s meeting with a powerful delegation of Fulani cattle owners from Northern Nigeria under the leadership of General Mohammadu Buhari discussed above was another instance of his intervention.

Unlike the police with whom the Fulanis had established some kind of rapport, a high court judge is virtually inaccessible. The Fulanis are said to be afraid of appearing before such a judge and are, therefore, prepared to negotiate settlement with the farmers through their lawyers.  The legal practitioner stated that many cases have been settled through this method. He was also of the opinion that this approach could have some deterrent effect as a Bororo herdsman who knows that if he destroys a farmer’s farm may end up paying substantial compensation may be wary of such act of destruction. Whether this approach would stand the test of time remains to be seen. "

It was also decided that except in cases involving death or injury, cases of misunderstanding should be resolved at the local level.
