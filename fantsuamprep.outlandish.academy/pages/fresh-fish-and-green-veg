One of these principles is the 'development of self contained horticultural systems modelled from natural ecosytems'. John told us at the meeting on Tuesday about the completion of two new earth ponds which had been dug at Attachab ready to be stocked with eight week old fish. The earth was dredged by hand using  shovels, axes and local tools. This provided work for ten young men over three days. One of the young men has a diploma from a fisheries institute while another used to work at a fish farm in Kaduna, the state capital.They were fuelled in their work by gari (dried cassava) soaked in water, and groudnuts.

A previous 'catch' from existing ponds proved very popular and was sold to staff and their families from Fantsuam Foundation and other visitors and users of the project. A few fish are still left, kept alive in a large tub in the Fantsuam compound ready for someone's meal. Fresh fish are of course highly valued and an excellent source of nutrition."
