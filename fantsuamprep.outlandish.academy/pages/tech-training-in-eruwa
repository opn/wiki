The team was full of admiration for the personal tutelage they received from world-renowned rural surgeon, Dr. Oluyombo Awojobi, the founder of ACE, and his team of dedicated staff. During their stay, the Fantsuam team had the rare privilege of working closely with Dr. Awojobi on his ward rounds, in the operating theatre, medical laboratories and in his biomedical engineering workshop."

The cost of a single drainable stoma bag is beyond the reach of the average rural patient but Awojobi’s colostomy bag is 15 times cheaper than the commercial version."
