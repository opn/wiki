I meant things that are much more personal and demand-driven, like being curious about something and then finding out, or needing a skill and practising it.

We accept that we don't mean the same thing by the word, but that my meaning is a possibility. We don't need to discuss it further. We can agree to differ in our usage. The other person can claim the moral high-ground and the \"true meaning of the word\". I'll admit I'm using it in an idiosyncratic way, and pop the adjective \"dadamac\" in front of it to flag that up i.e. \"learner\" (in formal educational context, being taught, etc) or \"dadamac learner\" (the meaning in my context).

The other person can claim the moral high-ground and the \"true meaning of the word\". I'll admit I'm using it in an idiosyncratic way, and pop the adjective \"dadamac\" in front of it to flag that up i.e. \"learner\" (in formal educational context, being taught, etc) or \"dadamac learner\" (the meaning in my context).
