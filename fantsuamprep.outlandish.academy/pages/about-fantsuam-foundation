        "text": "Fantsuam has grown solidly and organically to become one of the largest and most successful rural NGOs in rural Nigeria harnessing programmes across the different priority areas of health, education and livelihoods.  Fantsuam is committed to the practice of social business: both for the sustainability of the community it serves and for its own long term future.  Currently revenue from Fantsuam’s three social businesses: Microfinance, ZittNet (internet service provider) and Schools (ICT training) cover 64% of the organisation’s 18 million naira (€90,000) annual costs making it less reliant on external funders and more resilient to regional and global economic fluctuations."

This constant presence among its beneficiaries confers high credibility on the organization and assures the communities of our long term commitment to their prosperity. When individuals and families begin to work their way out of poverty, this has an effect on whole communities. The successful participants become the resource persons that are engaged to teach others the new principles."
