This approach requires the engagement of traditional, religious and community leaders, elders and influencers in inclusive, representative and reflective dialogue. This approach stops the continuing disruption of rural agrarian and pastoral economies across the sahel, especially Nigeria's middle belt, promote inclusive dialogue and enhance the dispute resolution processes. This is based on the premise that both the pastoralists and the farmers cannot achieve any meaningful developmental goals without peace.  "

These conflicts have been primarily about water and land use, damage to crops, blocking of transhumant corridors, farming along the valleys and stream/river banks and uncomplimentary agricultural policies by government. However, the problem between pastoralists and farmers is basically a development and economic challenge that ought to be tackled that way, instead of the current infusion of ethnic, religious and political factors into it."

The linkage of efficient grassland and livestock management for lasting peace, requires policy adjustments that enables the people to see the manifest advantages of the the approach. With existing scientific proofs, evidence is presented on the immediate, medium and pong term advantages of this holistic approach. Current agricultural and land management policies and programs are shifted in favour of environmentally sustainable solutions that create market-based incentives that lead to environmental, economic and social benefits."
