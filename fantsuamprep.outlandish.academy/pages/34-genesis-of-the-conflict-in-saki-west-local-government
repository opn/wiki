The company was owned by the government of the old Western State. The Bororo Fulani cattle rearers invaded the plantation and grazed down 22 hectares of cotton and 2.2 hectares of cassava. Following a security surveillance on 4th December, 1989, two suspects were arrested and taken to the plots see the havoc done and were later detained for questioning."
