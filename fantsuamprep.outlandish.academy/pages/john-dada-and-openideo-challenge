But it comes with little sense of ownership and local commitment is low thereby making these solutions unsustainable. The solution which we are prototyping in northern Nigeria has brought both communities of pastoralists and farmers together to fashion a community-owned ranch where all members have equitable access to the land and water resources. Fantsuam Foundation has facilitated the process as an impartial arbiter, supporting the process through resource mobilisation and providing training to users of the facility."
