      "text": "Learning-by-doing is a \"dance\" that takes many forms, and therefore many kinds of dance fit the analogy. In learning, as in dancing, you may be part of a wide circle, or in a set, in a group, with a partner, or alone. Some learning situations, and some dances, are very fluid and improvised, some are formally structured or carefully choreographed. There are the many hours put in, that no-one sees, where you are simply getting better at what you do. There's the fun stuff, in the company of others, with no external judgement or imposed standards, no-one trying to impress anyone, just participating for the joy of it. There are also public performances, with associated risks and vulnerabilities."

What kind of shared learning happens when two people come to a situation from opposite directions (i.e. opposing perspectives)? Will they take the opportunity to stop, and face each other and dance (learn) together, or will each try to push past the other to continue on their own way."

Will they gallop off in a direction that neither were facing when they came together (like a gallop in country dancing)? Will the leading and following roles shift subtly during the dance (like a tango)? Will it be slow and stately, wild and chaotic, will it be fun? Most importantly, will it be something trivial and temporary or part of something more ongoing. Will it become a way of doing things, a kind of shared movement, where skills are developed, trust is built and collaborations grow."
