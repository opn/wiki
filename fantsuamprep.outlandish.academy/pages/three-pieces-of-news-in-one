The building which is so vital to the well being of the traders in the market, particularly the women, has one block with 7 toilets constructed from locally made compressed bricks."

The Council is a voluntary association of traders and the completion of the block is in the interests of their members. Because the Council understand that Fantsuam Foundation is not making money from the project and all the necessary documentation has been completed and the permissions given, the Council ensure that no officials can attempt to extract any bribes for themselves or hold up the work. This is the third piece of news - that there is trust among stake holders in this local project so that corruption and inefficiency cannot effect the outcome. In this way the trust of the funders is repaid and provides the third piece of news."
