Bako has been working in the US but now has his own organisation in Kaduna. He is very excited by the project and facilitated the funding of three of the toilets by the US Embassy which has previously funded a number of Fantsuam projects including the new health centre. The other three toilets will be funded by the Kitchen Table Trust. Bako, like many other supporters of Fantsuam, is generously giving his help as a volunteer."

This discussion was triggered by Nikki moving to a different venture although still retaining her interest and support for Dadamac. I have always been amazed at Nikki's ability to understand and even visualise what goes on at Fantsuam even though she has never visited Nigeria. But this leaves Pam desperately in need of help and support in pursuing Dadamac's aim to promote effective collaboration between the 'outsiders' and the 'grassroots'.  She wants to make the work of Fantsuam and other projects more visible through Dadamac. She colourfully describes it as 'picnicing on the patio' hoping that others will want 'to eat with us, as we have such a feast of information'."
