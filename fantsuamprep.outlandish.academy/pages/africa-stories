There is nothing to draw on when the money runs out. A sad waste of time and effort, and a waste of *financial capital*.\n\n- On the other extreme are socially rich projects, where there is an abundance of knowledge, networks, vision, commitment to the long-term benefit of the community, and imaginative solutions to problems. The effort put in, however, is constantly undermined through lack of financial capital. Without the necessary material resources everything is a struggle, progress is much slower than it could be, and key people become exhausted. The project keeps stalling and never achieves its full potential. Another sad waste of time and effort, and a waste of *social capital*."

The internet may represent \"the death of distance\" from a geographic perspective, but it's not the death of distance from the perspective of cultural differences. These social challenges need to be recognised and negotiated. The ideal is to create an online meeting space which is equally accessable to everyone, from the technical point of view, and which is equally culturally comfortable to all. That's the ideal. Of course we live in the real world and compromises have to be made, but it is good to know the ideal that we strive for.\n\n- The work of Dadamac Foundation with Fantsuam Foundation is work between Dadamac in London and FF in Kaduna State in Nigeria, but the findings from that work aren't just local, they are widely relevant.

Such projects can provide wonderful equipment, and some impressive short-term measurable outcomes. However, if there is no social capital there is no depth (and possibly no relevance). There is nothing to draw on when the money runs out. A sad waste of time and effort, and a waste of *financial capital*.\n\n- On the other extreme are socially rich projects, where there is an abundance of knowledge, networks, vision, commitment to the long-term benefit of the community, and imaginative solutions to problems. The effort put in, however, is constantly undermined through lack of financial capital. Without the necessary material resources everything is a struggle, progress is much slower than it could be, and key people become exhausted. The project keeps stalling and never achieves its full potential. Another sad waste of time and effort, and a waste of *social capital*."

Communication between the UK and Africa was slow, expensive, and impractical for many projects. Fortunately the Internet and mobile phones have changed that.\n\n- There are still problems. It's not quite as simple as the hype would suggest, but there is a great transformation taking place.\n\n- Communication channels are open. The disconnect between financial capital and social capital can be ended. Social and financial capital can flow together. If there is willingness on both sides. Projects with social capital are well aware that they need finance. It's less obvious that projects with financial capital have the humility to recognise that they need social capital."

        "text": "- The work done by Dadamac with Fantsuam Foundation (FF), illustrated through Nikki's blogs from 2008-2012, demonstrate that effective communication and collaboration are possible at a distance. It's not, however, just a simple matter of exchanging email addresses or phone numbers.\n\n- There are many communication glitches to be addressed, and they are not just technical, they are also social. The internet may represent \"the death of distance\" from a geographic perspective, but it's not the death of distance from the perspective of cultural differences. These social challenges need to be recognised and negotiated. The ideal is to create an online meeting space which is equally accessable to everyone, from the technical point of view, and which is equally culturally comfortable to all. That's the ideal. Of course we live in the real world and compromises have to be made, but it is good to know the ideal that we strive for.\n\n- The work of Dadamac Foundation with Fantsuam Foundation is work between Dadamac in London and FF in Kaduna State in Nigeria, but the findings from that work aren't just local, they are widely relevant. The barriers we have faced, both technical and social, and the issues we have addressed, are common across the continent. "

Her grandmother’s approach was prosaic. As she explained years later to the grand-daughter, she wanted the money and there was no point trying to show the visitor how it really should be done because “You can’t tell these white people anything.”"

I have felt bewildered, confused, powerless and angry about the disconnect between things as they seem to me in the places I know in Nigeria and \"how Africa is portrayed\". I've also got increasingly cynical about \"aid' and \"development\", delivered in what I've come to see as a top-down, tick-box culture - but I won't go on about that. Binyavanga Wainaina explains it with a humorous light touch and far more credibility. I'll simply relate the video to my experience."

I had no idea if the words they spoke were genuine or just the emotion of the moment. Later I realised that while some of the people had a genuine connection to Peter's vision, some of the words were probably simple opportunism, based on the mistaken impression that Peter's project was fully funded and supported by a well established NGO. I knew too little for that idea to occur to me at the time."

After all, even though I had few resources of my own, there was the \"development community\" over here. Surely as someone who lived in the UK, I could help my new friends, through the work of DFID (Department for International Development) and researchers in university departments, and all that kind of thing. I just needed to connect."
