Since it is my place, I think i’ll be able to explain the rules of the game and framework of the whole day (from noon to midnight).\n\nThe subject of the FEAST could be making/cooking Means of Communication. that goes from establishing a personal wiki to knowing how to do an easy Coptic knot to bind a small notebook from discarded paper. Typewriters are available — for each group to dictate his findings to the secretary. It makes it fun, it makes a hell of a raucous and also provides means to reflect on the keyboards we play and are being played on. \n\nCollage as a collective permanent workshop will also be explored, alchemy on the table and alchemy in the baking ovens.\n"
