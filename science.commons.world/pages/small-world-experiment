The research was groundbreaking in that it suggested that human society is a small-world-type network characterized by short path-lengths. The experiments are often associated with the phrase \"six degrees of separation\", although Milgram did not use this term himself - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_experiment wikipedia]"
