      "text": "The Postmodernism Generator is a computer program that automatically produces imitations of postmodernist writing. It was written in 1996 by Andrew C. Bulhak of Monash University using the Dada Engine, a system for generating random text from recursive grammars. A free version is also hosted online. The essays are produced from a formal grammar defined by a recursive transition network. Nassim Nicholas Taleb writes about \"Monte Carlo generators\" in his 2001 book Fooled by Randomness as a real instance of the reverse Turing test: a human can be declared unintelligent if his or her writing cannot be told apart from a generated one. It was mentioned by biologist Richard Dawkins in the conclusion to his article \"Postmodernism Disrobed\" (1998) for the scientific journal Nature, reprinted in his book A Devil's Chaplain (2004) - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism_Generator wikipedia]"
