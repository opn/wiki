Your data is timestamped only if you or someone you trust keeping the real data. You are losing indipendence, uncensorability and eternity.\n\nSo, why not putting everything on the blockchain?\nBecause the blockchain is expensive. Decentralization is a tough business, coming to consensus and mantaining the data structure require that network nodes use a lot of resources.\n\nWhy timestamping hashes?\nBecause they scale without requiring one transaction for every hash. With a structure called merkle tree a lot of hashes could commit on a single one. You need to write in the blockchain only the tree root hash to make a commitment for every hash composing the tree.\n\nWhat about ownership?\nWith the current API working with email is already possible to sign documents but it’s up to the user. You can digitally sign your email with PGP or with the Estonian E-residency before sending.\n\nIs Eternity Wall storing the documents?\nEternity Wall is not storing the document after computing the hash. However attachments in email are readable during their travel, if you are concerned about privacy you can encrypt your data or wait for the client hashing service, soon available."
