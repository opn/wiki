(\"FUTON\" is an acronym for full text on the Net.) Scholars in some fields can more easily discover and access articles whose full text is available online, which increases authors' likelihood of reading and citing these articles, an issue that was first raised and has been mainly studied in connection with medical research. In the context of evidence-based medicine, articles in expensive journals that do not provide open access (OA) may be \"priced out of evidence\", giving a greater weight to FUTON publications.
