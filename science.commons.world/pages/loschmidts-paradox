      "text": "In the opinion of Schrödinger ([[Erwin Schrödinger]]), \"It is now quite obvious in what manner you have to reformulate the law of entropy—or for that matter, all other irreversible statements—so that they be capable of being derived from reversible models. You must not speak of one isolated system but at least of two,  which you may for the moment consider isolated from the rest of the world, but not always from each other.\" The two systems are isolated from each other by the wall, until it is removed by the thermodynamic operation, as envisaged by the law. The thermodynamic operation is externally imposed, not subject to the reversible microscopic dynamical laws that govern the constituents of the systems. It is the cause of the irreversibility. The statement of the law in this present article complies with Schrödinger's advice. The cause–effect relation is logically prior to the second law, not derived from it."
