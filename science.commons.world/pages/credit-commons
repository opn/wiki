Legal tender, and promises to pay legal tender are highly regulated. Government give themselves the right to define money on behalf of the people, then they spend, tax, monitor, order debts be discharged in, and surveil that money. Furthermore a bank’s promise to pay legal tender can be used completely interchangeably with legal tender itself, even for payment of taxes, even if the bank is insolvent! Although legal tender is supposed to be a way that a government can issue money from nothing, accountable to parliament according to the needs of the economy, it no longer serves the economy but only the banks. Control over the quantity of money has passed to the banks who now issue 97% of it, and not to serve the economy but to maximise rent income in the form of interest."

        "text": "We have seen above a kind of virtual money which exists on a ledger as the imbalance between accounts. There is no money, zero, in the ledger, but only account balances going up and down, their total always being zero.\nLedgers in banks and other corporations are used to store promises of real money, because it is easier to track and transport promises than cash. The intention is always to settle the balance at a later date with a single net payment; sometimes settlement is not even necessary if the net balance is close to zero. Sometimes these systems are said to provide liquidity because they allow payments without cash.\nA ledger used in this way, is called a credit clearing system. Before computers, all the cheques paid into the banks in one day would go to the clearing house where they would be added up and cancelled out. Banks would pay each other only the difference. Clearing means much the same even today: the hassle of moving actual money can be reduced insofar as transactions can be cleared beforehand, and this is precisely what ledgers do. And payment need never be made as long as accounts stay within a tolerable trustworthy distance of zero.\nConventional bank deposits are created on a balance sheet, thus as property, but on a ledger the payments between accounts are more like flows, or even relationships.\nLedger money is not minted or printed, it has no physical form and no fixed quantity. Starting from zero, Alice can pay Bob 10 units. Then Alice’s account is -10 and Bob’s +10. The total is zero. Bob can pay Carol, and Carol, Alice. When Alice’s balance is back to zero she can walk away, having paid and been paid without the hassle of shipping units back and forth in armoured vehicles.\nAnother way of looking at it is that spending and earning the internal currency units simultaneously creates and destroys ‘money’ such that, by definition there is always the right amount of it to represent the current credit/debit relationships.\nAlice’s having ‘owed’ the system for some time is not counted a debt and need not produce interest. In order for Bob to receive widgets before he paid widgets, someone else had to pay before they received. This is a reciprocal relationship and totally different from the commodity money paradigm in which the wealthy own all the money (or at least the right to promise what they don’t have) and rent it out to the poor. And let us not forget that what is really valuable here is not the money, but the goods and services flowing in the opposite direction!\nLedger money fulfils two of the three classical functions of money: the medium of exchange and the unit of account; but not the store of value function. Economists such as Silvio Gesell argued strongly that ‘money’ should not be intended as a long term store of value since the primary properties of money are its liquidity and virtuality. The store of value function should be performed by commodities or securitised commodities, and to expect money to perform all three functions is an error of thinking.\n",

        "text": "Using a ledger in this way, as a closed system with accounts extending credit to each other, is sometimes called mutual credit. This term focuses not so much on the clearing aspect, but on the fact that credit can be made available to anyone at any time, and the risk entailed by that credit is spread out across the whole system. In the event of an account being abandoned rather than being closed at zero, the whole system deviates from the perfect zero, and all members are affected equally when the total supply and total demand leave equilibrium.\nThis notion of economic equilibrium is a guiding principle of a mutual credit economy, and not of the global economy which is a competition to accumulate the most. Another word for economic equilibrium, is exchange, because parties give and receive in equal measure. When giving exactly equals receiving, the account balance is zero and only then may the account be closed. Since all accounts have agreed to close on zero, after Alice has paid Bob ten units, Alice is looking to earn 10 units and Bob is looking to spend ten units; thus supply equals demand. In a fiat or commodity money system, the governors, if they care, must use voodoo to calculate how much money to put into circulation for optimal trading without inflation, without bubbles, and without unemployment. In a mutual credit system this is a non-question. The political question then becomes, how much can people be trusted to deviate from zero and still return?\nThe further away a balance is from zero, the greater the risk that that account will fail to reciprocate. If no deviation were allowed there would be no liquidity and no trade. If infinite deviation was allowed, some players would only ever give and others only take. We observed earlier that supply always equals demand. Every force has an equal and opposite force. When accounts are hovering around their limits, struggling to reciprocate, that means there is equal and opposite pressure elsewhere in the system.\nA well-managed system will be able to mitigate these pressures by paying attention to those accounts and making it easier for them to trade back in the right direction.\nA poorly managed system may be lucky if negative failures to return to zero cancel out positive failures - defaults can be in either direction.\nOnce the design problem of how credit should be allocated is decided, perhaps by the people whose credit it is, which is everybody, then as much credit can be created as needed.\nAny system can of course have tweaks and redistributive mechanisms, but the fundamental properties are still important. Commodity money must be earned (or borrowed at interest) before it can be spent; the more of it you have, the better it is for you, though that might mean others are deprived. Those who have a scarce commodity (money), get more from renting it out. The day to day governance of such instruments is done through interest rate manipulation and taxing/spending, but the flagrant injustices of this paradigm are never fully mitigated by social security and other forms of redistribution.\nUsually some accounts have difficulty earning as much as they would like to spend and vice versa. Because these problems can affect the whole system, the whole system has an incentive to support those accounts, either by trading with them preferentially, redistributing credit or coming to some other arrangement. This mutual support is visible for what it is, not welfare bleeding out of the pay-packets of the people who actually work, but enabling everyone to both give and receive, which is essential for the health of the whole system.\nIt is well understood how spending locally can create a multiplier effect, and all local currencies seek to strengthen and make visible that virtuous circle. In that sense, a local currency can build solidarity within the local economy insofar as it actually diverts spending towards the local economy, which is a very difficult thing to measure.\nBut there is a deeper solidarity within a mutual credit system than within the multitude of Euro proxies which have sprung up in recent years. The value of the system depends on the engagement of the members and the quality of their experiences, which is the subject of the third paper in this series. The wealth gains that come from good governance, a glut of production and the wellbeing of the precarious members are spread around much more in a mutual credit system than in a commodity money system, where all the wealth gains are sent to the top of the pyramid as rents are adjusted.\nAll of which is why mutual credit is the money of the solidarity economy.\n",

        "text": "At the post WWII Bretton Woods conference, Keynes proposed that international trade be conducted through a country-to-country mutual credit system called the Bancor. The conference initially agreed the idea was sound and just, but then the USA unilaterally squashed the idea with a dollar/gold standard, then defaulted on their obligations and created the petrodollar system. Today few alternatives are discussed but the idea of going to back to the bancor has been mooted.\nThis is especially significant for an economy experiencing deflation - a scarcity of circulating money. The act of one account extending trust to another account to enable it to participate in a ‘split barter’ exchange can be seen as an act which creates liquidity. While ledgers are used throughout the financial world, there are much fewer examples of ledgers being used without the intention ever to settle, which is to say to settle debts through reciprocal exchange rather than money changing hands. \nThe most prominent is surely the business barter industry which helps businesses move unsold stock and get bums on otherwise empty seats, \nfollowed by the LETS movement which encourages the middle classes to meet each other and save money together. (French SEL, German Tauschkreis)\nfinally timebanking, in which poor and excluded people are given opportunities to support each other and build confidence. \nAt present a great many of these systems are poorly governed from a credit perspective and have a poor understanding of how mutual credit is supposed to work. Regulation within the business barter industry fails to prevent the owners of exchanges running up a deficit, which means buying all the best stuff and flooding the members with credit, and then never earning that credit back. Similar things happen in LETS and timebanks, but usually not for personal gain.\nThis has the effect that credit accumulates in members’ accounts and they want to spend, but the corresponding debit is not looking to earn. Thus the marketplace has more buyers than sellers and very often barter dollars change hands at less than parity with US dollars; inflation in these systems is a sure sign of poor governance. Bartercard national franchises do this routinely, I understand, but since their accounts are private, their innocence or guilt cannot be established.\nWhen the same things happens in LETS and timebanks, it matters much less because members depend less on these systems and are more forgiving. The governing board may decide to issue some credit to express the collective intention of the community, say to organise a festival, and the units may not be collected back in tax or entrance fees. The party account may stay negative forever and the corresponding units may slosh around creating a net positive balance in all the other accounts. Then someone might die with an equivalent positive balance and unwittingly the equilibrium is restored.\nI have heard members of business barter systems report that it didn’t work for them, never quite sure why it was so much easier to earn than spend the barter credit, members of LETS and Time banks almost always have positive experiences, often despite poor fiscal governance! The reason is because a mutual credit accounting system, accompanied by a directory of goods and services, exists to enable exchange and yields positive, productive relationships by the way. In contrast, the legal tender economy forces producers compete globally for every dollar or face poverty and shame languishing on the heap of the unemployed.\nMany members report feeling that this ledger money is easier to earn and less painful to give - it unlocks generosity.\n\n\f\n",

      "text": "# 4    Federating local currencies\nThe credit commons is the notion, perhaps first voiced by Tom Greco, that local ledgers should be connected together using public infrastructure rails, with each currency retaining control of its own issuance and balance of trade, but governed cooperatively. I hope to explore the details below.\nThere have been a great many local exchange platforms created in the last few years but no sharing of code and certainly no interoperability between them. Teams who want to facilitate community exchange have given all their effort to building custom software and not enough to re-usable software and not enough to building community.\nSee the appendix for a condensed list of community exchange platforms none of which are interoperable and many of which have failed to thrive owing to lack of uptake. \nNote that while the credit commons itself is proposed to be a mutual credit system, any type of currency could participate. All that is required of a candidate member is an account for import/export and trust from existing members that the candidate will return to zero.\nThis section discusses some of the design parameters of a mutual credit federation.\n4.1    Legal Structure\nThere are pros and cons to using formal structures. For example managing a bank account in the name of an association is easier and more trusted than someone’s personal account. My vision of the credit commons is an informal association, accountable only to its members, which does not handle money at all. This is how Bitcoin works. There is no association but anyone can install some free software and just plug into the network. Later the Bitcoin Foundation was created to help grow Bitcoin but many users didn’t regard the foundation as legitimate.\nBy contrast the credit commons would embody a similar libertarian ethic, but instead of being an open system without trust, it would consist of private groups who may or may or not trust each other. Thus anyone could open an account in a credit commons, but only trusted people and groups could exchange. In this arrangement I see no benefit to registering the credit commons as an organisation, since no money should change hands and no legal recourse is needed between trusted parties.\n",

      "text": "# 4.2    Governance\nThe most important governance question in a mutual credit system is to manage risk on behalf of all the members by determining the extent to which accounts can deviate from zero. Within a scarcity worldview, it is much more important to manage the negative limit both because members fear losing out and because there is more incentive to take without giving.\nSince the credit is mutually guaranteed by all member groups and by extension, all members of all member groups, it is critical that at least this part of the governing process be participative. The same principle applies in the legal tender economy, but there is no acknowledgement that it is workers who give value to money and risk management is done by banks only to maximise their profits and losses.\nAlso credit must be allocated as far as possible on a case-by-case basis. Banks are increasingly automating loan applications using algorithms, and while this is good for profits it does not serve entrepreneurs. The way to process credit applications more quickly is not through automation, but through the kind of aggregation we see in microcredit, where a loan request must be guaranteed by several people. In the credit commons a whole community would apply for credit from the collective of communities, and that community would guarantee that credit.\nThe governing process has other responsibilities, as in any community money system: managing relations and especially disputes between communities, monitoring communities who may be struggling with their balance of trade; recruiting new members, managing public perception.\nGovernance could be done by volunteers, or compensated volunteers. Any tax and any ‘wages’ could only be denominated in credit for goods and services.\nThere might be a centralised brokering service to stimulate trade, and that brokering might be paid for with taxes or transaction fees. Alternatively brokering could be done by private individuals who could earn commission, in credit.\n",

      "text": "# 4.3    Nesting\nThe credit commons is an open infrastructure for community currency groups to make multilateral exchange agreements. Those groups are private and voluntary associations of individuals who may invite others to join them. Thus newcomers could not automatically join a private group but could form their own group. There could be many networks there which are not connected at all and there could be hierarchies of groups. For example all the time banks in UK could form a group to manage hours liquidity amongst themselves and Timebanks UK could be part of another group of all the national timebanking associations, also using the same unit of account, hours, which is the defining feature of timebanking.\nAt each level of organisation there would need to be a governing process comprising all its members.\nSimilarly the business barter networks could have their own arrangements in the same credit commons without touching timebanking, or as long as exchange rate mechanism is agreed, it could touch timebanking.\nThus payments from user to another might be registered at several levels depending how far in network space, the payment is going. A payment to a timebank in another country would have to obey the balance limits of both groups concerned at each level.\nThe concept of nesting credit clearing systems has also been discussed in the International Journal of Complementary Currency research\n",

      "text": "# 4.4    Exchange rate mechanisms & balance limits\nThe impossible trinity applies equally to credit commons economies as to national economies:\nThe Impossible trinity (also known as the Trilemma) is a trilemma in international economics which states that it is impossible to have all three of the following at the same time:\nA stable foreign exchange rate\nFree capital movement (absence of capital controls)\nAn independent monetary policy. \nSince the credit commons is a tool for distributing political power and issuance of credit to the local level, independent monetary policy is not negotiable. A stable foreign exchange rate is maintained by curbing imports and exports, which is to say, balancing exports and imports. This gives every community an incentive to produce if wants to import and to spend if it wants to export. The designers of the Euro would have done well to apply such an ethic. Furthermore, speculation and price manipulation of currencies is contained according to the proportion of each community’s credit which is allowed to circulate outside its own accounts.\nThe post gold-standard FOREX system of currency exchange is a free market; this design has a self correcting mechanism which helps to keep prices stable. As the price of a currency deviates from its actual purchasing power, the price of goods and services in that country becomes distorted in a way that attracts trade in the opposite direction. For example, if a currency is undervalued, that country’s exports become cheaper, and demand for them increases, which drives up the currency price. This tendency towards stability is desirable in the credit commons.\nBut within that framework, it is possible for a community with a sovereign monetary policy, to stabilise its own prices using credit/debit allocated for that purpose. This is perfectly sound practice as long as the limits are respected. All communities are allowed to issue credit/debit and can use it equally for liquidity with other communities or for stabilising their own currency. In the case of fraud, damage would be limited only according to how much trust had been allocated to the rogue community, and would not be contagious.\nIn small scale systems the precise exchange rate matters much less. The largest community currency system has been running 15 years using exchange rates fixed a long time ago, and had no issues.\nThe question remains then, as explained above, how balance limits are decided between member exchanges. Greater balance limits mean greater risk, which is to say greater impact in case of failure to return to zero. Each group should decide its own process/formula through a political process. Limits should be imposed by a custom script or plugin in the accounting software and not set in stone. There are plenty of examples from which to take inspiration.\nIn the banking system it is normal to grant individuals overdrafts up to two months of salary without asking too many questions. Larger loans, for commerce and business startups, need to be scrutinised by the bank which has a mandate to be risk averse.\nEvery business barter network has its own formula or process for allocating credit, which usually takes into account the desirability of the applicants produce and their trading volume.\nWithin LETS, there are many theories about how balance limits should be determined. Typically a minimum limit is given to new members, which increases proportionately with volume of trade. \nBOX: In Western Austria 'talents' were flowing from a rural Tauschkreis to a nearby urban one and both systems on were stuck on their respective limits and in danger of freezing. They put their heads together and organised a rural festival and bussed in the city folk to spend their talents back and restore the balance.\n\n",

      "text": "# 4.5    Experiences of previous federations\nThe credit commons may be a new formulation, but the federation of local currencies has been attempted many times since the emergence of LETS in the 1980s.\n4.5.1    Business barter\nThe business barter sector has many federations already because this is the business model of the software providers.\nTypically one software is sold to as many exchanges as possible and the vendor takes a dollar commission from each inter-exchange transactions, which seems inappropriate because no dollars change hands and also disincentivises exchange, more so if the fee is high.\nThis model of federation serves the software providers more than the traders because it carves up the marketplace, keeping traders separate according to their exchange’s software choice. In this way of thinking, members are property to be owned, before they are customers to be served!\nThis way also causes problems because the software providers assume that each exchanges barter dollars are worth the same without checking the integrity of the exchanges, which all to often are suffering from a profligate house account.\nThe International Reciprocal Trade Organisation sought to improve the situation by introducing another currency governed by itself, called Universal Currency. The system is its own platform and thus members have the experience of being in two exchanges and using two currencies. In 2014 the system ran into liquidity problems and fraud allegations followed. The system has now been rebooted in partnership with Bartercard, but it is not clear that the governance problems were addressed.\n4.5.2    LETS\nIn the 1990s there were several attempts to make accounting software for LETS using databases on local machines. The most valiant attempt at intertrading using Access was in Scotland where everyone was using a well developed MS Access application called SAM. The LETS of LETS was held in a separate instance of SAM and transactions were communicated by email.\nAround 2003 CES arrived, a web service allowing LETS to have their own web site in which members managed their own accounts rather than processing cheques communicating by post. CES grew quickly when it offered an intertrading mechanism between exchanges. A fixed exchange rate was calculated according to the national currency and the time-value of each exchanges unit, and this persists to this day.\nThe author of this document and CTO of Community Forge attempted to improve the CES system with an open API and in 2012 but the task was too onerous.\nSeveral LETS around Zurich are networked together with a semi automatic system which requires they all use the same platform.\n4.5.3    Timebanking\nTimebanking software has always been much more centralised than LETS being produced by the national associations rather than the communities themselves. Thus all the timebanking platforms, sharing a unit of account have enjoyed a high degree of interoperability.\nThe initial USA and UK systems were poorly built and managed and eventually both gave way to a free, well run, but closed source platform which now hosts several hundred timebanks. This means those timebanks are interoperable in theory but so far no policy exists to manage trading limits and no API to include software hosted elsewhere.\n\n\n\f\n",

      "text": "# 5    Natural analogies\n5.1    A biomimicry perspective\nThis section was co-authored with Jamie Brown-Hansen.\nThe field of biomimicry is, among other things, a way of doing biology that looks for unifying patterns in the design of natural systems. There is enormous diversity in the natural world, yet biologists are able to identify certain design strategies that are common across multiple species and even kingdoms of species. Some of the deepest design patterns, in fact, can be recognised in almost all biological systems at every scale, from bacteria to multicellular organisms to entire ecosystems. These unifying patterns are referred to within the biomimicry community as Life’s Principles. They represent a design framework that has delivered thriving, regenerative systems in the natural world for 3.8 billion years, a proven recipe for long-term success within the operating conditions of this planet that we can apply where relevant in the effort to achieve sustainable human systems, including our systems of exchange.\nThe proposal of the credit commons is consistent with many of nature’s core unifying design patterns: it is bottom-up, locally attuned and adapted, diverse, decentralised, iterative, modular, and premised on quantitative stability over time. The interconnection of community-based mutual credit systems is also endorsed by the Bio-credits Working Group of the Biomimicry Global Network in answer to the question, “How would nature design a financial system?” The remainder of this section draws out some specific characteristics of the credit commons proposal that are consistent with natural system design.\n5.1.1 Locally attuned and adapted\nIn the natural world, chances of survival improve when organisms are well adapted and responsive to local conditions around them. Similarly, after decades of policy experimentation and experience, sustainable development strategists have learned that the most appropriate prescriptions for human development in any given region are attuned and adapted to local context. In the conventional bank credit system innovations in system design are templated first at the global level and make their way down to national level implementation thereafter, often without further adaptation to the contexts of individual communities.\nSome measures have shown strong correlations with good econometric outcomes across the board, such as investments in health, education and women. However, some experiences of standardised policy prescriptions applied to countries irrespective of local context have also been catastrophic. For example after the 2008 financial crisis, a committee in Basel required that banks to increase their capital requirements, which lead to a wave of debt-related suicides amongst farmers in India.\nThe credit commons starts with local innovation by communities themselves, attuned and adapted to their particular context and needs.\n5.1.2 Bottom-up development combining modular and nested components\nLiving systems assemble components one unit at a time, with development starting at the smallest scale. Simple solutions to a basic problem are nested within larger systems to form more complex entities. Starting with simple building blocks moving to more complex allows all the parts of the new system to grow and develop in response to local contexts, from the bottom up. This recalls the biological metaphor of cohabiting cells working together to form a multicellular organism. A cell is a (comparatively) simple entity and a life form in its own right. Biology gives us many examples of cells working together and specialising to make an organism with a higher degree of organisation.\nThe credit commons proposes that the economy be re-imagined from the bottom up in a self-organised manner analogous to the design process of the natural world. The power of the state to force citizens to accept its promises as money is anathema to notions of freedom of persons, and of markets. Considering the value of legal tender monies rests entirely on the productivity of the citizens, they are the natural candidates to issue promises for produce, if money be such. Systems in which a currency is imposed from the above lead to disparities in the availability of the currency, as we see in the Eurozone between Germany and Greece, for example. The biomimetic principle of designing from the bottom up would suggest every person, or more likely every economy, have its own currency for internal trade, and that complexity and scale be layered on top of that stable system.\n5.1.3    Embody resilience through systemic diversity and decentralisation \nClose to the principle of building from the bottom up is the principle of decentralisation. Many centres increases the resilience of the whole system, because it reduces dependences and single points of failure. Natural systems maintain function following disturbance by incorporating a variety of duplicate forms, processes, or systems that are not located exclusively together. \nThe Biomimicry Resource Handbook explains: “Resilience is the capacity of a system to maintain function following a disturbance. In short, it is the ability to recover after adversity. The capacity for resiliency, from bodily organs to ecosystems, often depends on the interconnectedness and functional diversity of multiple systems. When one system fails or does poorly, others can step in to compensate, either briefly or long term. As the nature of the disturbance is unpredictable, variation in strategies allows for some to endure while others may be lost. Redundancy permits the remaining to continue despite losing some, and decentralisation ensures that independent of where the disturbance falls, not all components will be subject to its impacts.”\nThe credit commons can be understood as a permaculture landscape of diverse local models interacting with each other, analogous to a natural ecosystem. A variety of locally attuned credit modules interacting in dynamic non-equilibrium is a more resilient structure than the metaphorical monoculture of today’s prevailing monetary system, according to former central banker, Bernard Lietaer.\n5.1.4    Protective membranes regulating in/out\nIn modern economies the balance of trade figure reveals how much value a country is gaining or losing. It is obtained by measuring the flow of the national currency across borders. It is very hard to obtain this figure for local or regional economies which use the same currency as their neighbours. With much more localised currencies, this figure can tell us a lot about microeconomic health and activity. Each member of a mutual credit network has a maximum extent to which its balance can deviate from zero. These limits function like a membrane of a cell, revealing the value going in and out to the wider system. In economic terms a balance-of-trade indicator is built in to each economy and the health and needs of each economy becomes visible. Limits can be set by local economy AND by the higher order system and the lowest limits respected. This affords local economies a level of protection against strong inflows or outflows of credit which would cause inflation/deflation and distort the value of their currency.\nAs the localities join together to form bioregions, and bioregions to form countries, transactions which have to pass between more balance limits, and more cultural barriers, become more cumbersome and probably more expensive. In this way the credit commons architecture favours localised exchange.\n5.1.5    Fractal design\nAs we have shown, clearing systems can be nested, with one clearing system having an account in a meta system. Smaller local modules are nested within larger regional modules, with the pattern repeated up to the global scale. This is consistent with the pattern of system design in the natural world from microorganism to biosphere. Moreover, not only are facilities in the credit commons modular and nested, they are also iterative. In other words, the same principles of organisation and engagement can be applied at each system level. This is analogous to patterns of fractal design in the nature world. \nFor example, in order for a mutual credit facility to function, all participants must agree to the principle of balanced mutual exchange. In other words, they agree to give and receive equally over the course of their membership in the credit community. Concretely, this can mean, for example, that participants must start with a balance of zero, and end with a balance of zero. This principle applies not just to individual participants in a local credit community, but also to local communities participating in a regional credit facility, and so on up to the global level. In the case of a regional facility, each local community agrees to balance its imports and exports in order to participate; the same principle applied at the next level.\n\nWe would suggest around 4 levels of nesting ranging from local systems to bioregional systems, to national or linguistic regions, to a world clearing system. This allows the same mechanism to serve at all scales of the economy and probably provides a bias towards more local trade, since currencies are more valuable nearer to where they can be spent. \n5.2    Money as flows in a field\nIt is tempting when exploring the True nature of money, as theologians study the bread in the Eucharist, to study the tokens and the exchanges. One popular approach is to posit a substance called 'value' which resides in the tokens, either intrinsically because the tokens are made of some valuable stuff (use value), or by government decree (exchange value). This is reminiscent of the theory of transubstantiation in which the bread somehow 'changes' into into the body of Christ.\nBut this whole approach assumes that money is some kind of stuff which moves from hand to hand. Even fiat money is a commodity insofar as it is valued for itself more than for what it can buy.\nWhen we look at the different ways of issuing money, we see clearly that 97% of modern money is NOT a commodity. It comes from nothing and exists only on bank balance sheets. This is accounting money, the kind used in mutual credit systems. And it has some other interesting properties:\nFor every unit of money created as a liability, there is a corresponding asset created with equal and opposite value\nThe money flows into circulation and at the appointed time some money - not necessarily the same money is pulled out of circulation and cancelled out against the asset, leaving nothing.\nWhen we look at cash we might imagine each piece moves around the economy independently of other money, like a ball bouncing randomly around a pinball machine. But with accounting money you can't mark the bills and track one piece of money just like you can't pinpoint an electron. A better analogy is a field.\nIt turns out that money is very like energy. By studying the substance we miss the wood for the trees. The paradox of money-as-a-commodity and money-as-a-promise is resolved once money is regarded as a circuit or as a wave acting in a field. It is created when no-value splits into assets and liabilities, just like when a neutral photon breaks into a positron and an electron which go spinning off in different directions and times. Money can be seen like electrons leaping from atom to atom, but look at the whole picture and money flows like a wave in a field, pushing waves before it and pulling waves behind it. What matters is not the atoms or the leaping, but the integrity and balance of the circuit. \nAt least, that's when it works.\nWhen we treat money as a commodity, the flows get out of sync. When we hoard money and relend the same money twice we prevent it from returning to source. When we just read the peaks and not the troughs, we miss the coming tsunami.\nWhen, for cultural reasons, borrowers take all the responsibility and risk, while lenders charge rent on their absent 'property' the two parties will never dance well together, leading to gluts and dearths and arhythmia.\nCredit money, or accounting money is very much like electricity, and the conceptual leap if we want master it is the same leap as from Newtonian mechanics to Quantum mechanics.\n\n\n\f\n",

      "text": "# Conclusion\nThere are no reliable statistics, but since the financial system transitioned into the realm of fiction in 2008, the present author has witnessed a noticeable growth in complementary currency activities. The LETS have been declining since at least the turn of the century. Time banking has benefitted from institutional support and more favourable legal rulings, and there are several projects which fit neither family. I judge that the success rate of currency projects remains very low. This is because most complementary currencies are started by an isolated enthusiast, but they can only succeed when many people actively participate. Awareness that money itself may not be a neutral commodity is certainly growing, but that understanding is a long way from making a conscious decision to invest effort in the local economy, and to do so outside of legal tender money.\nIt will be argued therefore, that the very notion of a local economy is so eroded in a global society, and money itself so aspatial, and local money systems so lacklustre that there is nothing to federate.\nBut it can also be argued that a credit commons would strengthen all the local systems, giving them new uses and wider relevance. Local currencies would undoubtedly be more useful if they could be spent in other localities. In addition, the process of making local systems interoperable will increase awareness about how money systems could be run, and what is possible once we learn to cooperate.\nFinally, human architectures of exchange may be better positioned to serve as an organ of planetary ecology, fostering global conditions conducive to biological life, if their patterns of development are consistent with the bottom-up pattern of systems innovation in the natural world. The consistency of design principles can allow human and natural systems to flow more seamlessly together so that “the city can no longer be distinguished from the forest” from a systems design perspective. \nEnough open source software already exists (some created by the author of this document) for local communities to design and own local exchanges.
