      "text": "Adab al-Tabib (Arabic: أدب الطبيب‎‎ Adab aț-Ṭabīb, \"Morals of the physician\") is the common title of a historical Arabic book on medical ethics, written by Al-Ruhawi, a 9th-century physician. The title can be roughly translated \"Practical Ethics of the Physician\". As the name suggests, it focuses on adab, the Islamic concept of etiquette and personal ethics, as it is defined in a medical context. One of the earliest texts on Islamic medical ethics, it has been called the \"crowning achievement\" of early works concerning adab in medicine - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adab_al-Tabib wikipedia]"
