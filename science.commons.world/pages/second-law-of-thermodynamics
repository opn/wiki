      "text": "The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time. It can remain constant in ideal cases where the system is in a steady state (equilibrium) or undergoing a reversible process. The increase in entropy accounts for the irreversibility of natural processes, and the asymmetry between future and past - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics wikipedia]"
