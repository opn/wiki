      "text": "The Center for Open Science is a non-profit technology organization based in Charlottesville, Virginia with a mission to \"increase the openness, integrity, and reproducibility of scientific research.\" Brian Nosek and Jeffrey Spies founded the organization in January 2013, funded mainly by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation and others, after implementation and use of the Open Science Framework. The organization began with work in reproducibility of psychology research. See reproducibility project. A second reproducibility project for cancer biology research has also been started through a partnership with Science Exchange. In March 2017, the Center published a detailed strategic plan. Brian Nosek posted a letter outlining the history of the Center and future directions - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Open_Science wikipedia]"
