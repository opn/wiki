He built upon this idea in a paper to the ACM in 1965, calling the new idea \"zippered lists\". These zippered lists would allow compound documents to be formed from pieces of other documents, a concept named transclusion. In 1967, while working for Harcourt, Brace, he named his project Xanadu, in honour of the poem \"Kubla Khan\" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge."

He built upon this idea in a paper to the ACM in 1965, calling the new idea \"zippered lists\". These zippered lists would allow compound documents to be formed from pieces of other documents, a concept named transclusion. In 1967, while working for Harcourt, Brace, he named his project Xanadu, in honour of the poem \"Kubla Khan\" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge."
