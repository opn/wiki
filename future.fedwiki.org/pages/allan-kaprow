In it he demands a \"concrete art\" made of everyday materials such as \"paint, chairs, food, electric and neon lights, smoke, water, old socks, a dog, movies.\" In this particular text, he uses the term \"[[happening]]\" for the first time stating that craftsmanship and permanence should be forgotten and perishable materials should be used in art - [http://members.chello.nl/j.seegers1/flux_files/kaprow_chronology.html chello.nl]"

      "text": "Kaprow's most famous happenings began around 1961 to 1962, when he would take students or friends out to a specific site to perform a small action. He gained significant attention in September 1962 for his ''Words'' performance at the [[Smolin Gallery]]. However, the ritualistic nature of his happenings is nowhere better illustrated than in ''Eat'' (1964), which took place in a cave with irregular floors criss-crossed with puddles and streams. As Canadian playwright [[Gary Botting]] described it, \"The 'visitors' entered through an old door, and walked down a dark, narrow corridor and up steps to a platform illuminated by an ordinary light bulb. Girls offered red and white wine to each visitor. Apples and bunches of bananas dangled from the ceiling and a girl fried banana fritters on a hotplate. In a small cave, entered only by climbing a ladder, a performer cut, salted and distributed boiled potatoes. In a log hut, bread and jam were served. Bread was stuffed between the logs. The visitors could eat and drink at random for an hour. There was no dialogue other than that used in the interaction of the visitors with the performers.\"  Botting noted that ''Eat'' appealed to all the senses and superadded to that was the rhythmic, repeated ticking of metronomes set at the pace of a human heartbeat, simulating ritualistic drumming. Furthermore, \"The 'visitors' were involved physically (by being required to walk, eat, drink, etc.), mentally (by being required to follow directions), emotionally (by the darkness and strangeness of the interior of the cave), and mystically (by the 'mystery' of what is beyond the walls of the hut or in the inner cave.\"  In short, Kaprow developed techniques to prompt a creative response from the audience, encouraging audience members to make their own connections between ideas and events. In his own words, \"And the work itself, the action, the kind of participation, was as remote from anything artistic as the site was.\"[http://www.jca-online.com/kaprow.html Allan Kaprow] He rarely recorded his Happenings which made them a one time occurrence.[ ]"

The minute those elements break down, he can get more disposable materials together and produce another improvisational master piece.
