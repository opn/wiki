Each table will have a facilitator, and should we have enough participants for several tables, people will be encouraged to move from table to table in order to experience the decentralised nature of the learning architecture.\n\nWe will encourage online participation, and for people to continue this process after MozfFest through a series of Full Moon happenings that we are organising around the world. In this way people who turn up on Saturday, can take part at home on Sunday, and continue their involvement through the monthly Full Moon events."
