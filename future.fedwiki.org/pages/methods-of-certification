When the CA is a third party separate from the user and the system, then it is called the Registration Authority (RA), which may or may not be separate from the CA. The key-to-user binding is established, depending on the level of assurance the binding has, by software or under human supervision."

The top spot has been held by Symantec (or VeriSign before it was purchased by Symantec) ever since [our] survey began, with it currently accounting for just under a third of all certificates. To illustrate the effect of differing methodologies, amongst the million busiest sites Symantec issued 44% of the valid, trusted certificates in use — significantly more than its overall market share.\""

The singular term \"web of trust\" does not imply the existence of a single web of trust, or common point of trust, but rather one of any number of potentially disjoint \"webs of trust\". Examples of implementations of this approach are PGP ([[Pretty Good Privacy]]) (Pretty Good Privacy) and [[GnuPG]] (an implementation of [[OpenPGP]], the standardized specification of PGP). Because PGP and implementations allow the use of [[e-mail]] digital signatures for self-publication of public key information, it is relatively easy to implement one's own web of trust."

If the \"web of trust\" is completely trusted then, because of the nature of a web of trust, trusting one certificate is granting trust to all the certificates in that web.  A PKI is only as valuable as the standards and practices that control the issuance of certificates and including PGP or a personally instituted web of trust could significantly degrade the trustability of that enterprise's or domain's implementation of PKI."

The top spot has been held by Symantec (or VeriSign before it was purchased by Symantec) ever since [our] survey began, with it currently accounting for just under a third of all certificates. To illustrate the effect of differing methodologies, amongst the million busiest sites Symantec issued 44% of the valid, trusted certificates in use — significantly more than its overall market share.\""

The singular term \"web of trust\" does not imply the existence of a single web of trust, or common point of trust, but rather one of any number of potentially disjoint \"webs of trust\". Examples of implementations of this approach are PGP ([[Pretty Good Privacy]]) (Pretty Good Privacy) and [[GnuPG]] (an implementation of [[OpenPGP]], the standardized specification of PGP). Because PGP and implementations allow the use of [[e-mail]] digital signatures for self-publication of public key information, it is relatively easy to implement one's own web of trust."

If the \"web of trust\" is completely trusted then, because of the nature of a web of trust, trusting one certificate is granting trust to all the certificates in that web.  A PKI is only as valuable as the standards and practices that control the issuance of certificates and including PGP or a personally instituted web of trust could significantly degrade the trustability of that enterprise's or domain's implementation of PKI."
