An important short-term advantage of this is that it allows the creation of an online distributed catalog of patterns with advanced searching and browsing capabilities, as well as reference-based and feature-based navigation. In addition to this, the management of patterns as complex objects with advanced presentation capabilities (such as for instance condensing or expanding sections, using different views, etc.) will represent an advance that is easy to achieve but very valuable in practice.\n</li>"

      "text": "<ul><li><b>Detailed and precise.</b> Patterns must allow experts to capture a rich set of characteristics and details with enough rigor and precision to suit the needs of different users and scenarios but without sacrificing their generality, which is necessary in order to ensure their reusability. In order to achieve this, both syntax and semantics of patterns need to be redefined to ensure that patterns produced by different sources are comparable and understandable. We believe that ontological support can be the basis to achieve this goal. In principle, ontological support can help improving selection capabilities, and interoperability of patterns from different sources. The approach we propose to follow is based on previous results on secure decentralized ontologies, which can easily be adapted to JSON. In essence, the idea is to allow the inclusion of references to external \"ontologies\" in different fields of the patters. As a simple example, the security properties provided by a security pattern could be related using external ontologies. Assume the “Authentication” property provided by the “Credential” pattern has the following relations to other properties:\n“Authentication” equals “Client Authentication”\n“Mutual Authentication” implies “Client Authentication”\nIn this way, a search for a pattern providing the “Authentication” property would return all patterns providing any of the “Authentication”, “Client Authentication” or “Mutual Authentication” properties, as all of them could fit the original goal of the developer. Of course, pattern search mechanisms should provide flexible interfaces allowing system engineers to decide if ontology-supported equivalence is used or not in a given query. Another example in the security domain is using ontologies to relate threats to actual attacks. Finally, ontologies become an essential tool in order to ensure that patterns provided by different entities can be understood and compared. \n</li>"

Therefore, we propose the inclusion of mechanisms guaranteeing the quality and integrity of the pattern. This is related to the concept of provenance in the sense that it covers origin and authorship, but also the aspects of reuse, adaptation and extension, also inherent to provenance. Of course, relations between patterns must be considered. Additionally, we believe it would be useful to have mechanisms for associating some sort of “reputation” (i.e. community-based evaluation) to the patterns, but this should be done independently to the pattern content. In this context, the concept of \"Endorsement\" can be a valid solution as it allows trust to be based on actors other than the pattern creator.</li>\n</ul>"

In order to achieve this, both syntax and semantics of patterns need to be redefined to ensure that patterns produced by different sources are comparable and understandable. We believe that ontological support can be the basis to achieve this goal. In principle, ontological support can help improving selection capabilities, and interoperability of patterns from different sources. The approach we propose to follow is based on previous results on secure decentralized ontologies, which can easily be adapted to JSON. In essence, the idea is to allow the inclusion of references to external \"ontologies\" in different fields of the patters. As a simple example, the security properties provided by a security pattern could be related using external ontologies. Assume the “Authentication” property provided by the “Credential” pattern has the following relations to other properties:\n“Authentication” equals “Client Authentication”\n“Mutual Authentication” implies “Client Authentication”\nIn this way, a search for a pattern providing the “Authentication” property would return all patterns providing any of the “Authentication”, “Client Authentication” or “Mutual Authentication” properties, as all of them could fit the original goal of the developer. Of course, pattern search mechanisms should provide flexible interfaces allowing system engineers to decide if ontology-supported equivalence is used or not in a given query. Another example in the security domain is using ontologies to relate threats to actual attacks. Finally, ontologies become an essential tool in order to ensure that patterns provided by different entities can be understood and compared. \n</li>"

Therefore, we propose the inclusion of mechanisms guaranteeing the quality and integrity of the pattern. This is related to the concept of provenance in the sense that it covers origin and authorship, but also the aspects of reuse, adaptation and extension, also inherent to provenance. Of course, relations between patterns must be considered. Additionally, we believe it would be useful to have mechanisms for associating some sort of “reputation” (i.e. community-based evaluation) to the patterns, but this should be done independently to the pattern content. In this context, the concept of \"Endorsement\" can be a valid solution as it allows trust to be based on actors other than the pattern creator.</li>\n</ul>"

An important short-term advantage of this is that it allows the creation of an online distributed catalog of patterns with advanced searching and browsing capabilities, as well as reference-based and feature-based navigation. In addition to this, the management of patterns as complex objects with advanced presentation capabilities (such as for instance condensing or expanding sections, using different views, etc.) will represent an advance that is easy to achieve but very valuable in practice.\n</li>"

In order to achieve this, both syntax and semantics of patterns need to be redefined to ensure that patterns produced by different sources are comparable and understandable. We believe that ontological support can be the basis to achieve this goal. In principle, ontological support can help improving selection capabilities, and interoperability of patterns from different sources. The approach we propose to follow is based on previous results on secure decentralized ontologies, which can easily be adapted to JSON. In essence, the idea is to allow the inclusion of references to external \"ontologies\" in different fields of the patters. As a simple example, the security properties provided by a security pattern could be related using external ontologies. Assume the “Authentication” property provided by the “Credential” pattern has the following relations to other properties:\n“Authentication” equals “Client Authentication”\n“Mutual Authentication” implies “Client Authentication”\nIn this way, a search for a pattern providing the “Authentication” property would return all patterns providing any of the “Authentication”, “Client Authentication” or “Mutual Authentication” properties, as all of them could fit the original goal of the developer. Of course, pattern search mechanisms should provide flexible interfaces allowing system engineers to decide if ontology-supported equivalence is used or not in a given query. Another example in the security domain is using ontologies to relate threats to actual attacks. Finally, ontologies become an essential tool in order to ensure that patterns provided by different entities can be understood and compared. \n</li>"

Therefore, we propose the inclusion of mechanisms guaranteeing the quality and integrity of the pattern. This is related to the concept of provenance in the sense that it covers origin and authorship, but also the aspects of reuse, adaptation and extension, also inherent to provenance. Of course, relations between patterns must be considered. Additionally, we believe it would be useful to have mechanisms for associating some sort of “reputation” (i.e. community-based evaluation) to the patterns, but this should be done independently to the pattern content. In this context, the concept of \"Endorsement\" can be a valid solution as it allows trust to be based on actors other than the pattern creator.</li>\n</ul>"
