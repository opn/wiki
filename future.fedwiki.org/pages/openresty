The hardware used to run OpenResty also ranges from very big metals to embedded devices with very limited resources. It is not uncommon for our production users to serve billions of requests daily for millions of active users with just a handful of machines.\n\nOpenResty is not an Nginx fork. It is just a software bundle. Most of the patches applied to the Nginx core in OpenResty have already been submitted to the official Nginx team and most of the patches submitted have also been accepted. We are trying hard not to fork Nginx and always to use the latest best Nginx core from the official Nginx team."
