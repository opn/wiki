The social structure within the Federation is classless ([[Classless society]]) and operates within a money-less \"New World Economy\". The Federation is described as stressing, at least nominally, the values of universal liberty, equality, justice, peace, and cooperation.[ The Star Trek Encyclopedia: A Reference Guide to the Future][http://io9.gizmodo.com/5965604/the-secret-history-of-star-treks-utopian-federation/ The Secret History of Star Trek's Utopian Federation] The Federation also maintains its own quasi-militaristic and scientific exploratory agency, known as [[Starfleet]] (also written as \"Star Fleet\" in some texts). Starfleet is seen handling many other governmental processes, sometimes with no other agency's influence, such as border defense, diplomatic envoy and has seen extensive use as an offensive military force."
