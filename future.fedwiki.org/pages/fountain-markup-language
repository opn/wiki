No need for specific screenwriting software.\n\nThe magic that Screenplain performs is to take your plain text file and convert it to a good looking screenplay in an industry standard format. Send that file off to your producer, agent, director or screenwriting competition. Currently, the supported output formats are FDX and HTML."
