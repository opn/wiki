A change in human language.  The Bible is written in hyper text now.  They called or emailed Geneva and got the discussion going as asked.  They reported that a whole groups of people asked for the proposal to be drafter and a prototype created (adding clickable text to a word processor). Yes it was a slow way to do it But if I had called apple we could have had it it sooner.  Just [open document] when you click on a word.  it would have taken then days.  I felt the browser was so earth shattering that it required unbiased people to work on public software.  We see today the results of Google hiding everyone's websites.  Global collapses.

To \"talk it up\" and get international cooperation for what was admittedly something way bigger than anyone appreciated.  A change in human language.  The Bible is written in hyper text now.  They called or emailed Geneva and got the discussion going as asked.  They reported that a whole groups of people asked for the proposal to be drafter and a prototype created (adding clickable text to a word processor). Yes it was a slow way to do it But if I had called apple we could have had it it sooner.  Just [open document] when you click on a word.  it would have taken then days.
