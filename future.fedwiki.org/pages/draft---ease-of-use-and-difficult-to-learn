I put this down in part to the WikiWord, which encourages topical titles. but it also is a function of indexing - topics make pages and specific info findable. And it may be a function of the kinds of projects that find their way to traditional wikis: encyclopedias, documentation ... And, certainly, it's in part a function of the shared singularity of the traditional wiki. the users - readers and contributors - coalesce around a set of commonplaces - topics - that they co-operatively define and refine in their shared creation. Makes sense. Those shared topics - commonplaces - provide the co-operative group with a shared set of terms, values, views. At the same time, there's a sense of how the topic constrains the group into a singular understanding rather than a plurality. Writers tended to create multiple topics to articulate the multiple perspectives. WhyWikiIsGood spawns WhyWikiSucks, which illustrates the heuristic value of topics."

Include the original title (better: title and first para, as in a reference) in the new node.
