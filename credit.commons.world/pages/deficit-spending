This is derived from [[Keynesian economics]], and gained acceptance (especially in the Anglo-Saxon world) during the period between the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s and post-WWII ([[Post-World War II]]) in the 1950s."

        "text": "The deficit spending requested by [[John Meynard Keynes]] for overcoming crises is the monetary side of his economy theory. As investment equates to real saving, money assets that build up are equivalent to debt capacity. Therefore, the excess saving of money in time of crisis should correspond to increased levels of borrowing, as this generally doesn't happen - the result is intensification of the crisis, as revenues from which money could be saved decline while a higher level of debt is needed to compensate for the collapsing revenues. The state's deficit enables a correspondent buildup of money assets for the private sector and prevents the breakdown of the economy, preventing private money savings to be run down by private debt. The monetary mechanism describing how revenue surpluses enforce corresponding expense surpluses, and how these in turn lead to economic breakdown was explained by [[Wolfgang Stützel]] much later by the means of his [[Balances Mechanics]]."

In a quip, \"fiat money governments are 'spend and tax', not '[[tax and spend]]'\"—deficit spending comes first. Chartalists argue that nations are fundamentally different from households. Governments in a fiat money system which only have debt in their own currency can issue other liabilities, their fiat money, to pay off their interest bearing bond debt. They cannot go bankrupt involuntarily because this fiat money is what is used in their economy to settle debts, while household liabilities are not so used. This view is summarized as:"

In the absence of sufficient deficit spending, money supply can increase by increasing [[financial leverage]] in the economy—the amount of [[bank money]] grows, while the [[base money]] supply remains unchanged or grows at a slower rate, and thus the ratio (leverage = credit/base) increases—which can lead to a [[credit bubble]] and a [[financial crisis]]."

      "text": "The deficit spending requested by [[John Meynard Keynes]] for overcoming crises is the monetary side of his economy theory. As investment equates to real saving, money assets that build up are equivalent to debt capacity. Therefore, the excess saving of money in time of crisis should correspond to increased levels of borrowing, as this generally doesn't happen - the result is intensification of the crisis, as revenues from which money could be saved decline while a higher level of debt is needed to compensate for the collapsing revenues. The state's deficit enables a correspondent buildup of money assets for the private sector and prevents the breakdown of the economy, preventing private money savings to be run down by private debt. The monetary mechanism describing how revenue surpluses enforce corresponding expense surpluses, and how these in turn lead to economic breakdown was explained by [[Wolfgang Stützel]] much later by the means of his [[Balances Mechanics]]."
