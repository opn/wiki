It was on the eastern side of [[Sydenham Hill]] which runs south west to north east along a ridge 100m above sea level. Consequently the Common was tipping rainwater gently down toward the [[River Pool]]. As such, the Common had several rivulets which had been tamed by ditches and agricultural ponds. This explains why the canal company sited a large reservoir on the common as it intercepted these hillside streams to keep it topped up. This in turn kept the [[Croydon Canal]] topped up. When the reservoir was drained and auctioned in plots, the printer [[Robert Harrild]] acquired the plot in the area west of the canal and around what is now [[Albion Millennium Green]]."
