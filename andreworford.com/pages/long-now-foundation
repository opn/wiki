        "text": "The Long Now Foundation, established in 1996, is a public, non-profit organization based in San Francisco that seeks to become the seed of a very long-term cultural institution. It aims to provide a counterpoint to what it views as today's \"faster/cheaper\" mindset and to promote \"slower/better\" thinking. The Long Now Foundation hopes to \"creatively foster responsibility\" in the framework of the next 10,000 years. In a manner somewhat similar to the Holocene calendar, the foundation uses 5-digit dates to address the Year 10,000 problem (e.g., by writing \"02018\" rather than \"2018\"). The organisation's logo, a capital X with an overline, is a representation of 10,000 in Roman numerals - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Now_Foundation wikipedia]"
