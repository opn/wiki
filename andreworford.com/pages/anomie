It is the breakdown of social bonds between an individual and the community, e.g., under unruly scenarios resulting in fragmentation of social identity and rejection of self-regulatory values. It was popularized by French sociologist Émile Durkheim in his influential book Suicide (1897). Durkheim never uses the term normlessness; rather, he describes anomie as \"derangement\", and \"an insatiable will\". Durkheim used the term \"the malady of the infinite\" because desire without limit can never be fulfilled; it only becomes more intense - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomie wikipedia]"
