Coleridge claimed to have perceived the entire course of the poem in a dream (possibly an opium-induced haze), but was interrupted by this visitor from Porlock while in the process of writing it. Kubla Khan, only 54 lines long, was never completed. Thus \"person from Porlock\", \"man from Porlock\", or just \"Porlock\" are literary allusions to unwanted intruders who disrupt inspired creativity - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_from_Porlock wikipedia]"
