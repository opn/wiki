It has been set backward and forward 22 times since then, the smallest-ever number of minutes to midnight being one (in 1962) and the largest seventeen (in 1991). As of January 2018, the clock is set at two minutes to midnight, due to global threat of nuclear war, the United States not being involved in world leadership roles, and climate change."
