The voluntary nature might be imaginary, due to [[social pressure]], especially in small communities; and honour and reputation may be severely damaged by non-attendance or laziness. The task of the ''talkoot'' may be something that is a common concern, for the good of the group, or it may be to help someone with a task that exceeds his or her own capacity. For instance, elderly neighbours or relatives can need help if their house or garden is damaged by storm, or siblings can agree to arrange a party for a parent's special birthday as a ''talkoot''."

The parents of pre-school children may gather to improve the playground, or the tenants of a tenement house may arrange a ''talkoot'' to put their garden in order for the summer or winter. A person unable to contribute with actual work may contribute food for the ''talkoot'' party, or act as a baby-sitter. When a ''talkoot'' is for the benefit of an individual, he or she is the host of the talkoot party, and is obliged to offer food and drinks according to capacity."
