There was an art installation in Sydney that consisted of a white room in which a long and wide table was piled high with thousand pieces of white lego. No one seemed to expect it. But people came in from the street, sat down, and started to put pieces together, without a goal or purpose except that it was there and possible. Opposite me, two adult men were sitting in silence, cracking tiny bricks together. After a while they started to talk. It turned out they were father and son. They reminisced about the son's childhood, and their shared relationship with his mother, all the while each making something. When they got up and left, their two small constructions were left on the table. I was the only person who heard the story that went with them. Someone else would have come along later that day or that week and picked up those constructions and reworked them. Now I think maybe this is the nature of the unfinishable work: being a person in a community that knows nothing of each other except that history will look back at us and see that we were all here at this time."
