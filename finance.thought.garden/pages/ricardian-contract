Publication of the content and reference to that content by the unique [[cryptographic message digest]] eliminates frauds based on multiple presentations."

From a computing perspective, the Ricardian contract is a [[software design pattern]] to digitize documents and have them participate within financial transactions, such as payments, without losing any of the richness of the contracting tradition. Publication of the content and reference to that content by the unique [[cryptographic message digest]] eliminates frauds based on multiple presentations."
