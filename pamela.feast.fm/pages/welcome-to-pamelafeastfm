You are invited to come along too. \nPractical action\n\nThis is an action oriented site. Our future focus is on a genuine three-day event to be held in September Twenty Twenty-Seven. We aren't expecting Utopia by 2027 but we are expecting significant changes, and at the event we're planning to celebrate the changes that have taken us closer to our preferred vision for the future.\nThe event is called \"Exponentially Human 2027\" (the name is explained here - Name Exponentially Human)\nExploring the \"Landscape of Change\"\n\nThe only thing that seems certain about the future is that things are changing and will continue to change. We are living our lives in a \"Landscape of Change\". Visionary people and organisations are exploring different possible futures. Some of those futures are ones we hope to celebrate in the 2027 event.\nA future worth celebrating\n\nPeople have different hopes, values and viewpoints. I know that you and I may not have the same idea of a better future. But perhaps there is plenty of overlap. If so, you may like to head in the same direction as me, and various explorers and pioneers in the Landscape of Change. Let's take steps in a future direction where it makes sense to be celebrating changes in 2027\nLook around and think about participating\n\nYou are invited to look around. If you like the direction we're going, and the things we hope to be celebrating in 2027, now is a good time to be thinking ahead about your involvement in the 2027 celebrations and the preparations for them.\nStart reading about Exponentially Human here\n\nIntroduction to Exponentially Human\nIf you've been here before\n\nYou may like to go straight to \nExponentially Human Twenty Twenty-Seven; A mixture of fact and fiction\nXHuman2027 Planning: for an overview of the Exponentially Human Twenty Twenty-Seven event\nExponential Leap Publication Something special that we'll be lanching\n"
