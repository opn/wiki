They come down traditional grazing corridors,  and it used to work fine. The system is breaking down for a variety of reasons.  These reasons are illustrated in the conflict around where John is, but they are also evident down in Oyo state but without the same level of violence.  Oyo state is where Gbade is and where he studied the issues in greater depth. I know some of the places he refers to - like the Fulani market in Ago-Are.  On my first trip to Ago-Are I remember the car stopping to let the Fulani herdsmen take the herd across the road. I've visited two different kinds of Fulani villages in the bush. I've tasted the soft cheese the Fulanis sell. I guess if we were stuck I could say something about some of the things Gbade mentions. But it would be much better to have him talking about it.)"
