The internet may represent \"the death of distance\" from a geographic perspective, but it's not the death of distance from the perspective of cultural differences. These social challenges need to be recognised and negotiated. The ideal is to create an online meeting space which is equally accessable to everyone, from the technical point of view, and which is equally culturally comfortable to all. That's the ideal. Of course we live in the real world and compromises have to be made, but it is good to know the ideal that we strive for."

The internet may represent \"the death of distance\" from a geographic perspective, but it's not the death of distance from the perspective of cultural differences. These social challenges need to be recognised and negotiated. The ideal is to create an online meeting space which is equally accessable to everyone, from the technical point of view, and which is equally culturally comfortable to all. That's the ideal. Of course we live in the real world and compromises have to be made, but it is good to know the ideal that we strive for."
