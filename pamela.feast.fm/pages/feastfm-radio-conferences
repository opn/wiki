It allows people to respond to what they heard in the first programme. The FEAST magic is how they do that response, and how we feed it into the end programme.\n\nThe beginning radio programme is broadcast by a radio station, which also broadcasts the final programme. The programmes are also recorded as podcasts.\n\nListeners may listen to the first programme live, or via podcasts. If they listen to web-based broadcasts or podcasts they listen on their smart phones. When they give feedback, or ask questions, they don’t phone in live. They use WhatsApp. They don’t sent text messages on WhatsApp they send small sound files. \n\nThe FEAST magic is in with way the sound files are created and used. There are two kinds of FEAST magic. One relates to the way that we edit the small sound files to feed into the end radio programme. The other relates to the training courses we are planning to do for some FEAST participants to help them become mini sound studios. They won’t be sending in simple small sound files. They will be sending in mini podcasts. So, from some listeners we will be getting simple comments and questions, and from others we will be getting an edited local picture in sound. All this will be edited and fed into the radio programme that ends the conference.\n\nOver time, as FEAST increases its reach through a number of FEASTfm radio conferences, so the number of local mini-studios we have trained and equipped will increase, all adding to the magic.\n\nAs time passes the number of radio studios and radio stations that are linked through FEAST will increase. There will be a sharing of syndicated FEAST podcasts. A podcast which has been “the plenary” of a conference broadcast by one radio station may become source material for the “keynote” broadcast of a radio conference elsewhere.
