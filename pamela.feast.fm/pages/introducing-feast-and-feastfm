The easiest way to introduce this amazing and exciting initiative is through a taster of the FEAST that will be happening in September 2017. There will be more in the future.\n\nFamiliar ingredients\n\nFEASTs are made up of a number of familiar ingredients - but they are being combined in a new and exciting way. There is no way I could explain all the possibilities, so I’ll describe it from my perspective, which is how the UK side of FEAST will connect with people in my network in Nigeria. You could also be involved in similar ways - and other ways that I’ll explain later -  wherever in the world you are. \n\nRadio stations on the Internet\n\nThanks to the Internet and the way we will share content, you can listen in from anywhere, using your mobile phone. If you’ve never listened to local radio stations via the Internet before you may like to explore some by visiting www.radio.garden and moving your cursor to various parts of the globe. \n\nPhones and websites and other ways to get involved “locally”\n\nAs I mentioned before, there will be many ways to get involved. Phones are other “ingredients” of FEAST, and websites. There will also be local face-to-face events. These are already starting to get set up in North London. But local means local - i.e. where-ever people happen to be.\n\nThere will be FEAST happenings with a focus on food and art and music, and more besides. There will be live events, and podcasts, and radio programmes, but I have to start somewhere and I’m starting with the radio stations and a UK-Nigeria connection.\n\nThe radio stations\n\nThe first ingredients for the UK-Nigeria part of FEAST are two radio stations, far away from each other. They have very different content, and very different audiences. Thanks to their connection to the September FEAST they are going to twin with each other. \n\nIn Nigeria is a friend of mine, John Dada. He is the director of Fantsuam Foundation. As a respected figure in the local community he is a regular contributor to his local radio station in Kafanchan, and he knows the people there well.  \n\n\n\nFor FEAST the Kafanchan radio station will twin with a London University radio station. It serves the students and staff at SOAS (the School of Oriental and African Studies). Before the September FEAST people at the two radio stations will get to know each other. They will swap some content from their programmes so that, during the FEAST, content from Kafanchan will be transmitted for the SOAS audience, and SOAS content will be transmitted for the Kafanchan audience. That is just the start. \n\nIntroducing John Dada\n\nTechnology is important. We couldn’t do the September FEAST, without it, but the people are more important. I’ll introduce John Dada briefly through a couple of video clips. \n\nJohn talking about Fantsuam Foundation and his interest in getting the local community online - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajY1fJxGH3s - Short video recorded by Brian Griffin during an informal meeting at Impact Hub Kings Cross when John was in London in 2015. \n\n“John Dada on the challenges of using broadband for development in a northern Nigerian town” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSmy-fGxVPE&t=3s - Smart Monkey TV Interview - 8 minutes. (Also made during John’s January 2015 visit to London) - Includes information about Kafanchan where the radio station is. \n\nMore radio stations\n\nThere will be other radio stations involved in FEAST as well. If more than two want to swap content then they can. \n\nThings get more dynamic when lots of different radio stations get involved, and things happen in real time, and there is audience participation from around the world. But in my explanations I will start simply, with some of the “ingredients”, and I will gradually put it all together.\n\nPre-recorded, live or a mixture.\n\nThere are all the usual possibilities for the content of the programmes to be transmitted during FEAST. The ones that happen will depend on what the individual programme producers choose to do. Some producers may like to get everything recorded in advance. Some may like to do everything live. Others may like a mixture. The programmes may be serious or light-hearted, speech or music. It can be any kind of programme that the producer decides to produce. \n\nSome producers may like to work in real time with another radio station, merging their content and creating a shared programme. Some may go for maximum audience participation. There will be many different FEASTfm radio programmes during the September FEAST. \n\nThere will also be FEAST activities that are not being transmitted - but more about those later.\n\nThe audience\n\nThe most important part of a radio programme is the audience.  The special features of FEAST.fm  come in when audience participation is included, and when radio stations in different parts of the world combine. \n\nWith traditional radio people can simply listen or they can join a phone in. With FEAST.fm the audience can do more, especially if they want to put in some extra time before-hand to do some preparation. \n\nI’ll explain about that in a separate post. It may sound a bit techie at first, but we’ll help you to learn what to do. If you get really enthusiastic about it all, we can teach you how to prepare a mini radio programme to send in for possible inclusion, and we’ll teach you how to get involved with the minimum of equipment.\n\nI’ll also explain how local musicians and artists can use FEAST to promote their work, and how cafes, caterers and food growers can benefit as well. To illustrate that aspect of FEAST I’ll be far away from Nigeria, looking at the FEAST events in and around Finsbury Park in North London. \n\nFEAST.fm takes the opportunities of the technology to a new level, but it’s not about the tech. It about us, the people, listening and contributing in any way we choose. It’s about what we can do through the tech. It’s about connecting with each other locally, or at a distance, or a mixture of both. It’s about enjoying each other's company and culture. It’s about virtual feasts, and real ones. It’s about groups of people getting together to eat together, enjoy making music, or listening to it, and connecting with others doing similar things via FEAST.fm\n"
