But over the years, the Bitcoin mining system has increasingly centralized into fewer hands and fewer geographical regions. There are several explanations for this trend. But one of them is the emergence of specialized mining hardware: ASIC chips and miners.\nIn an attempt to solve this issue, scientists at the University of Luxembourg’s Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT) have developed a mathematical algorithm called “Equihash.” Equihash is the brainchild of Prof. Alex Biryukov, head of SnT research group “CryptoLUX” — focused on research and technology transfer in cryptology — and CryptoLUX researcher Dr. Dmitry Khovratovich. The algorithm was first unveiled at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium 2016 in San Diego."
