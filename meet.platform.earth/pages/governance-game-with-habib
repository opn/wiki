We want a governance game we create for our methodology for our own use, and to get it clear and sorted.\n1. We want to integrate this physical card / board game thing into software - so the designs and the workflow we take as a specification for the software - got a pretty clear idea of how that works with wiki and microservices and app development.\n1. We want stories and videos and a \"help feature\" / walk through / story board for how our software and governance works - so we can use the governance game to create that as a by-product as well."
