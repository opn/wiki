      "text": "In \"Heart of Enterprise\" a companion volume to \"Brain...\", Beer applies Ashby's ([[William Ross Ashby]]) concept of (Requisite) Variety ([[Variety (cybernetics)]]): the number of possible states of a system or of an element of the system.  There are two aphorisms that permit observers to calculate Variety; four Principles of Organization; the Recursive System Theorem; three Axioms of Management and a Law of Cohesion. These rules ensure the Requisite Variety condition is satisfied, in effect that resources are matched to requirement."
