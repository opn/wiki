Customer (''A'', left-hand side) approaches a hawala broker (''X'') in one city and gives a sum of money (red arrow) that is to be transferred to a recipient (''B'', right-hand side) in another, usually foreign, city. Along with the money, he usually specifies something like a password that will lead to the money being paid out (blue arrows).\n2. The hawa calls another hawala broker ''M'' in the recipient's city, and informs ''M'' about the agreed password, or gives other disposition of the funds. Then, the intended recipient (''B''), who also has been informed by ''A'' about the password&nbsp;(2a), now approaches ''M'' and tells him the agreed password&nbsp;\n3a. If the password is correct, then ''M'' releases the transferred sum to ''B'' (3b), usually minus a small commission. ''X'' now basically owes ''M'' the money that ''M'' had paid out to ''B''; thus ''M'' has to trust ''X''s promise to settle the debt at a later date."
