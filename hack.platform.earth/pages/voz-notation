If you need to be precise please use the above full typed notation, or the symbols (currenlty in design process).\n\nFor short-hand purposes, the casual verbal use of \"voz\" will refer to Kronos (voz-Y). To be more specific / pedantic use \"voy\" - which means \"I do\" or \"am going to make\". This convenience short-hand is used as this is the most common place to start and currently the only currency we are using (though we aim to change this in the coming weeks by introducing voz-X or \"vox\"). As we eventually introduce the reputation currency (voz-Z) we will probaly need to drop the verbal use of \"voz\" to refer causally to the time-based currency.\n\nIn terms of typing in this document we seek to use a machine readable way to enter information in simple text - let's call this \"currency markdown\". Currency transactions houls be entered in bracketted text like this: (+2x) or (-4y). The context of who it is from and where it is going should be able to be calculated from the document - we will work out those details later, but it will be something along the lines that the document itself will be on behalf of an owner  (the document owner), and a secion will be maked up with a title which refers to another entity - ie \"David (report back)\". From that it can be infered by a program that (+2y) means the \"Voz Account\" is to pay \"David\" two time-credits or \"voy\". The paragraph containing the markup (together with a link to the document(s) would be saved as the description of the transaction.\n\nTo be more explicit, or to overide the document contexts you can use notation like this (+2y to David), or (+3x to David from Voz), or (+2y to David from Voz for facilitating the meeting on 22nd March). The code parsing the text should be intelligent enough to deal with this syntax.
