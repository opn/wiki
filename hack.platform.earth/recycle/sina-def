What I mean by calling myself as 'a creative' is that I have an incessant need to be creating, feeding my curiosity and using my imagination. This is not always reflected in my career, or in the mundanity of daily life - however, it is essential for me to keep my creative juices flowing in order to maintain a healthy mental state and satisfy my soul. My goal in life is to find peace and understanding, and then spread it like a happy contagion. I hope to leave this Earth having offered much love to as many people as possible; I believe that the most effective way for me to obtain these goals (as a creative) is through my writing."
