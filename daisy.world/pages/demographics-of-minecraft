The player demographics within Minecraft can reveal a lot about the popularity of this game. For instance, the largest demographic is that of 15-21 year old’s, which comprise a vast 43% of the player base. the 22-30 year old age bracket consists of just over 21% of the base. Rounding out the top three is the under 15 age bracket, which averages to 20.59%. The lowest player demographics happen to rest with the 61-80 age brackets, which is to be expected. While these numbers may not seem wholly important on their own, it’s essential to understand that they can tell a lot about the types of people the game is aimed towards. These numbers show that, while gamers of all ages play this game, it’s typically played by teenagers, as they comprise over 60% of total players.\n\nWhile teenagers may be the central demographic, the overall numbers are a bit misleading at face value. The two most important numbers within all of them are the under 15 and over 30 numbers. The fact that over 20% of the Minecraft player base are children and young teenagers should not be ignored, even if the 15-21 percentage is higher. Most video games tend to do well with either children or young adults, but rarely both. This fact displays that it isn’t merely one demographic that this game does well with, but a variety. This is also true with the over 30 age brackets, as nearly 15% of players being over the age of thirty is a superb number for any game. The last reported number of copies sold of this game sit at just over 33 million, which means that nearly five million players are over the age of thirty.\n\nAs for which countries play the game the most, North America is in first place, while the UK is in second, with the majority being male gamers, though that percentage has gone down as of late. In 2011, The demographics for male and female players sat at 94% male and 6% female. This stark difference has reportedly gone down in the most recent years, largely due to Minecraft moving to the Xbox 360, which is reported to be the gaming platform with the highest percentages of female gamers - [http://minecraft-seeds.net/blog/minecraft-player-demographics/ minecraft-seeds.net]"
