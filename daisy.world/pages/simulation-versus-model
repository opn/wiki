      "text": "A [[computer model]] is the algorithms and equations used to capture the behavior of the system being modeled. By contrast, computer simulation is the actual running of the program that contains these equations or algorithms. Simulation, therefore, is the process of running a model. Thus one would not \"build a simulation\"; instead, one would \"build a model\", and then either \"run the model\" or equivalently \"run a simulation\" - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Simulation#Simulation_versus_model wikipedia]"
