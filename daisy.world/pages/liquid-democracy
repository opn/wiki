Delegative democracy was gradually eroded in favor of more representational forms of governance.\n\nThe [[Industrial Workers of the World]] labor union uses multiple levels of democracy, including delegative democracy. Local branches are controlled directly democratically by local members.

This yearly ballot is also used to elect members to various union administrative roles. Alternatively to the delegative process, members may add proposals to the ballot by initiative.\n\nThe first example of delegative or Liquid Democracy using a software solution in a real political setting was the local political party [http://www.demoex.net Demoex] in a suburb of Stockholm called Vallentuna, initiated by the teacher Per Norb√§ck and the entrepreneur [[:sv:Mikael Nordfors|Mikael Nordfors]] using a software solution called NetConference Plus.
