All claims for SolarCoin will require meter derived proof from a verified generation source and owner. The SolarCoin community will vet all verification methodologies. These methods will rapidly adapt efficiencies seeking maximum ease of use while preventing fraudulent claims.\n\nMost electric meters have online APIs and web reporting. These can be integrated with SolarCoin verification methods. Inverter manufacturers, meter companies and large systems integrators are invited to partner with SolarCoin to integrate customer web based reading methodologies with the SolarCoin granting community."
