      "text": "''Compute!'s Apple Applications'' in 1987 stated that HyperCard \"may make Macintosh the personal computer of choice\". While noting that its large memory requirement made it best suited for computers with 2MB of memory and hard drives, the magazine predicted that \"the smallest programming shop should be able to turn out stackware\", especially for using CD-ROMs.[ ] ''Compute!'' predicted in 1988 that most future Mac software would be developed using HyperCard, if only because using it was so addictive that developers \"won't be able to tear themselves away from it long enough to create anything else\".[ ] In 2001 [[Steve Wozniak]] called HyperCard \"the best program ever written\".[ ] - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercard#Reception wikipedia]"
