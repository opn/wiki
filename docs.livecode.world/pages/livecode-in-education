Due to the nature of LiveCode we have been able to focus on the principles behind good coding, and use both time and resources to become better at problem solving rather than to learn the intricacies of a specialised programming language. As far as I know, we are the only school in Norway to use LiveCode as the preferred tool in this subject.\n<p>\nOn behalf of my students, I am very happy with the results, and I very much look forward to teach programming with LiveCode to yet another group of students next year.\n</blockquote>"
