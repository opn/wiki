Virtually all of the object-oriented languages that came after—Flavors ([[Flavors (programming language)]]),[http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/MIT/nnnfla1-20040122.pdf Flavors A non-hierarchical approach to object-oriented programming] [[CLOS]], [[Objective-C]], Java ([[Java (programming language)]]), Python ([[Python (programming language)]]), Ruby ([[Ruby (programming language)]]),[https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/ About Ruby] and many others—were influenced by Smalltalk. Smalltalk was also one of the most popular languages with the [[Agile Methods]], Rapid Prototyping ([[Rapid application development]]), and Software Patterns ([[Software design pattern]])[http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/where-did-refactoring-come-from Where Did Refactoring Come From?] communities.

In addition to Smalltalk working prototypes of things such as [[hypertext]], GUIs, [[multimedia]], the mouse, [[telepresence]], and the Internet were developed by ARPA researchers in the 1960s.[http://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_darpa.htm DARPA / ARPA][http://www.dougengelbart.org/firsts/internet.html Engelbart's Role in Early Computer Networking] Alan Kay (one of the inventors of Smalltalk) also described a tablet computer he called the [[Dynabook]] which resembles modern tablet computers like the iPad.[http://gagne.homedns.org/~tgagne/contrib/EarlyHistoryST.html The Early History of Smalltalk]"

      "text": "Smalltalk environments were often the first to develop what are now common object-oriented software design patterns. One of the most popular is the [[Model–view–controller]] pattern for User Interface design. The MVC pattern enables developers to have multiple consistent views of the same underlying data. It's ideal for software development environments, where there are various views (e.g., entity-relation, dataflow, object model, etc.) of the same underlying specification.  Also, for simulations or games where the underlying model may be viewed from various angles and levels of abstraction.[ A Cookbook for Using the Model-View-Controller User Interface Paradigm in Smalltalk -80]"

The powerful built-in debugging and object inspection tools that came with Smalltalk environments set the standard for all the [[Integrated Development Environment]]s, starting with [[Lisp Machine]] environments, that came after.[http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/main/about-us/the-big-influence-of-smalltalk/ Our Influence]"
