Bill Atkinson later lamented that if he had only realized the power of network-oriented stacks, instead of focusing on local stacks on a single machine, HyperCard could have become the first Web browser."

HyperCard had a significant impact on the web as it inspired the creation of both [[HTTP]] itself (through its influence on [[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s colleague [[Robert Cailliau]]), and [[JavaScript]] (whose creator, [[Brendan Eich]], was inspired by [[HyperTalk]]). It was also a key inspiration for [[ViolaWWW]], an early web browser."
