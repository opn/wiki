Institutions, and funders often lack the understanding of decentralised practice, modern software development, and recent advances in the internet - particularly at the management level. Assessment criteria tend to be based on track record and eminence, while experts in the field tend to remain outliers. Pointing this out, is unlikely to go down well on funding applications. Failure to communicate these issues tends to steer projects in unproductive directions."
