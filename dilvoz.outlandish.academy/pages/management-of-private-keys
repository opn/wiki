Public key infrastructure is core to every aspect of decentralised governance, from blockchain, to secure and private communications (often required in product development between geographically separate members), to legal governance and democratic control. We therefore require a pragmatic approach to the management and recovery of these keys, without hindering longer term security issues or compromising our aims of creating decentralised democratic governance of the federation. This is a technical and social challenge.\n"
