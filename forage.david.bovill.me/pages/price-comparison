One solution is to have only one site, but regulate it as a public utility. Alternatively, the government could run the site itself—much as the American government now runs comparison websites for health insurance under Obamacare.\n\nBut creating good search and comparison sites is hard, and governments are unlikely to do a good job of it. The Obamacare websites were riddled with problems on launch. Much better to acknowledge that consumers will always have to do some comparison themselves to “keep the system honest”, argues Tony Curzon-Price of Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority."
