Building on trust, we are rediscovering how to be citizens in civilization together. The effects of this shift will catalyze every sector of human activity, a process we've only just begun.\n\nhttp://therexpedition.com/\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* \n(*Subject to certain rules and regulations)"
