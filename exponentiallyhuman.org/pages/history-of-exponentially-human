Shall we do that before I leave?\n- You'll be doing a time capsule won't you? We could do one with people sending in photos.\n- Let me introduce you to FEAST (it just happened to be a perfect prototype for Exponentially Human 2027 with its combination of distributed conference, celebratory party and more)  \n- Have you got a domain name you'd like to use on Federated Wiki (and Federated Wiki just happened to be the perfect pnline environment for starting to create a digital publication and immersive experience as envisaged for \"The Exponential Leap\")\n- You're a crazy woman...  It actually makes sense... I'd like to organise activities there that we can't do yet... for instance a version of Formula One for flying cars\n- If you're using #XH2027 on twitter shall I take @XH2027 for us too?\n- Slack is a good way to organise things, I'll set one up for XH2027\n- I've got an idea for selling tickets exponentially\n- I've registered the domain xh2027.org for you and set it up as a wiki farm\n- I'm setting up a website ready to show people when we meet on September 17th 2017\n- I've designed a logo - let me know if you approve before I show it on the website. )\n"
