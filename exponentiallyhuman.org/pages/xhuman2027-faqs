The minimum requirements to run your event are:\n- A location where as few as two people (or as many as a whole unconference full of people) can meet face-to-face and can also connect with others at a distance (in a 2027 version of how we currently \"meet at a distance\" using our smart phones or other devices that access the Internet).\n- Events related to the Exponentially Human theme organised within the date range of 16-18 September 2017.\n- At least one face-to-face session - whatever is appropriate to the group's size and interests; conversation / workshop / demonstration / open-space etc. \n- At least one \"fluid walls session\" where people can connect with your event at a distance. \n- At least one session when you connect with a \"fluid wall session\" arranged by some other Exponentially Human 2027 group.\n- Optional but strongly encouraged - a celebratory party including  the local launch of \"Exponentially Human\" - which ideally will include something contributed by you and/or your group any time between now and then. \n"
