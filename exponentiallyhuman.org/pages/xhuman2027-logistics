It will combine events organised by groups that do meet locally with events organised by groups that only meet in the cloud. \n \nParticipants at Exponentially Human (XHuman) Twenty Twenty-Seven will choose from a mixture of local events and online events. It will be possible to join online events without being part of a local group - but it won’t be the full experience.\n \nGroups that meet locally will be able to offer one or more “fluid wall” (online) sessions so that people elsewhere can join them at a distance. \n \nLocal groups can also meet together to join online events run by others, and for their own XHuman themed local sessions (offline), and for a local party (possibly shared online) at the end. \n \nSome larger groups may decide to run a full three-day conference and closing party. \n \nThe complete programme will run for three days with many sessions running in parallel. Given the global spread of local events, and the online sessions, there will probably be something happening around the clock. Participants may have some hard choices to make about what to attend. For anyone who wants to catch up afterwards there will be plenty of opportunities to visit archives of events, and to offer feedback and questions for follow up sessions.\n"
