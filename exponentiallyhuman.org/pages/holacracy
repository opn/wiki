A holarchy is composed of holons ([[Holon (philosophy)]]) (Greek: ὅλον, holon neuter form of ὅλος, holos \"whole\") or units that are autonomous and self-reliant, but also dependent on the greater whole of which they are part. Thus a holarchy is a hierarchy of self-regulating holons that function both as autonomous wholes and as dependent parts."
