      "text": "Withdrawal from the European Union has been a right under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union of EU member states since 2007. The details of the process for the UK's withdrawal are uncertain under EU law – Article 50, which now governs the withdrawal, has never been used before. Unless extensions are agreed, the timing for leaving under the article is two years from when Britain gives official notice, but this official notice was not given immediately following the referendum in June 2016. The assumption is that during the two-year window new agreements will be negotiated, but there is no requirement that there be new agreements."
