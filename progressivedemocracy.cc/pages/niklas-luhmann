That is, Luhmann in fact suggests to substitute the paradigm of systems theory for the ontological paradigm: the difference system/environment (which also signifies a relationship)."

Finally, the systems' autopoietic closure is another fundamental difference from Parsons' concept.

For example, the economy is all about money, so there is no independent role in the economic system for extraneous aspects such as morals.

In Luhmann's terms, human beings are neither part of society nor of any specific systems, just as they are not part of a conversation. Luhmann himself once said concisely that he was \"not interested in people\". That is not to say that people were not a matter for Luhmann, but rather, the communicative actions of people are constituted (but not defined) by society, and society is constituted (but not defined) by the communicative actions of people: society is people's environment, and people are society's environment. Thus, sociology can explain how persons can change society; the influence of the environment (the people) on the system (the society), the so-called ''\"structural coupling\"''. In fact Luhmann himself replied to the relevant criticism by stating that \"In fact the theory of autopoietic systems could bear the title ''Taking Individuals Seriously'', certainly more seriously than our humanistic tradition\" (Niklas Luhmann, ''Operational Closure and Structural Coupling: The Differentiation of the Legal System'', Cardozo Law Review, vol. 13: 1422). This approach has attracted criticism from those who argue that Luhmann has at no point demonstrated the operational closure of social systems, or in fact that autopoietic social systems actually exist. He has instead taken this as a premise or presupposition, resulting in the logical need to exclude humans from social systems, which prevents the social systems view from accounting for the individual behavior, action, motives, or indeed existence of any individual person.[ Autopoiesis in Organization: Theory and Practice]"

That is, Luhmann in fact suggests to substitute the paradigm of systems theory for the ontological paradigm: the difference system/environment (which also signifies a relationship)."

Upon Luhmann's attempt of defining the relationship value of environment/system we can see a reluctantly atheist approach denying the 'cause' of the creator."
