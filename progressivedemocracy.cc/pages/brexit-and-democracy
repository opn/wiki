The language used points strongly towards a conservative restatement of the status quo with regard to representative democracy. I see nothing that is likely to change any of these long term processes in the current analysis - for which I feel we need a deeper look at this question of the role and nature of what has been termed here as \"structure\".\n\nStructurally we need to take an uncomfortable look at this status quo, and look at how we can recombine the strong points of each element in not just new ways, but with new language which captures different values. If the end result of the analysis is simply more of the same (but a bit better) then I think we have failed.\n\nFor that we need to take lessons from other fields. We need to look at law - not as a set of bureaucratic procedures, but as an alternative form of social organisation. Juries are after all an ancient form of democratic organisation. We also need to look at media, markets and at what we have learnt from the internet and social media.\n\nLiquid Democracy is in many ways one such mashup. It took elements of social networks, markets, and threw in some mathematics regarding reputation and resilience. It asked what would happen to conversation if we allowed votes to flow through the network, and looked to create structures which would progressively incentivise deeper and richer local conversations.\n\nI started to work on that in the late 90's while working on coding alternative currency systems and democratic \"procedures\". Two things soon became clear - first off the surprisingly close parallels between these token-exchange games (votes and money), and secondly (and more importantly) the vastness of the unexplored universe of alternatives to these systems.\n\nHowever this was fully dangerously inclined towards a cybernetic styled technotopia. More click-bait beckoned. What I felt was missing is a stronger framing and protection for richer human centred conversation. After all if the \"diluted power\" is to be \"represented\" effectively (using the language of the article), then we need to ensure that the values being weighed and passed up through the network are worth accounting for.\n\nThis short note is getting too long for this medium. My main point here is that we need to take significant chunks out of law (redefining it's substantial nature to bring it within the democratic family), as well as media (which I would argue we need to cross-breed with a richer conception of scientific debate - as well as with ideas of documentary and the role of satire an humour).\n\nI believe when we look back at our current democratic and financial systems from a hundred years time, we will \"remember\" them in much the same way that we currently perceive Morse code - as weirdly anachronistic. Perhaps that's not the right word - I would hope rather we keep a certain fondness if not amazement as to how on earth we ever thought we could govern a planet by shovelling around tokens mediated by advertisements. We now have modern voice, video and internet based communication - Morse code was great in it's day, but with an impossibly primitive interface, and completely unable to capture a whole range of human value.\n\nLet's look to the see what it would take to move from here to there. We won't get there with a conventional understanding of representative hypocrisy."
