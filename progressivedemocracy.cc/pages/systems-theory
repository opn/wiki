        "text": "The core element of Luhmann's theory, pivots around the problem of the contingency of the meaning and thereby it becomes a theory of [[communication]]. Social systems are systems of communication, and society is the most encompassing social system. Being the social system that comprises all (and only) communication, today's society is a world society. A [[system]] is defined by a boundary between itself and its environment ([[social environment]]), dividing it from an infinitely complex, or (colloquially) chaotic, exterior. The interior of the system is thus a zone of reduced complexity: Communication within a system operates by selecting only a limited amount of all information available outside. This process is also called \"reduction of complexity\"."

        "text": "Furthermore, each system has a distinctive identity that is constantly reproduced in its communication and depends on what is considered meaningful and what is not. If a system fails to maintain that identity, it ceases to exist as a system and dissolves back into the environment it emerged from. Luhmann called this process of reproduction from elements previously filtered from an over-complex environment [[autopoiesis]] (pronounced \"auto-poy-E-sis\"; literally: self-creation), using a term coined in [[cognitive biology]] by Chilean thinkers [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]]. Social systems are ''operationally closed'' in that while they use and rely on resources from their environment, those resources do not become part of the systems' operation. Both thought and digestion are important preconditions for communication, but neither appears in communication as such. Note, however, that Maturana argued very vocally that this appropriation of autopoietic theory was conceptually unsound, as it presupposes the autonomy of communications from actual persons. That is, by describing social systems as operationally closed networks of communications, Luhmann (according to Maturana) ignores the fact that communications presuppose human communicators. Autopoiesis only applies to networks of processes that reproduce themselves,[ Autopoiesis: The organization of living systems, its characterization and a model] but communications are reproduced by humans. For this reason, the analogy from biology to sociology does not, in this case, hold.[ From Being to Doing: The Origins of the Biology of Cognition] On the other hand, Luhmann explicitly stressed that he does not refer to a \"society without humans\", but to the fact that communication is autopoietic, in the sense that communicative actions result to communicative actions, that is communication manifests itself only as communication (communication results in more communication, or the end of communication thereof)."

        "text": "Luhmann likens the operation of autopoiesis (the filtering and processing of information from the environment) to a program ([[program (management)]]), making a series of logical distinctions (in German, ''Unterscheidungen''). Here, Luhmann refers to the British mathematician [[G. Spencer-Brown]]'s logic of distinctions that Maturana and Varela had earlier identified as a model for the functioning of any cognitive process. The supreme criterion guiding the \"self-creation\" of any given system is a defining [[binary code]]. This binary code, is not to be confused with the computers operation: Luhmann (following Spencer-Brown and [[Gregory Bateson]]) assumes that auto-referential systems are continuously confronted with the dilemma of disintegration/continuation. This dilemma is framed with an ever-changing set of available choices; everyone of those potential choices can be the system's selection or not (a binary state, selected/rejected). The influence of Spencer-Brown's book, ''[[Laws of Form]]'', on Luhmann can hardly be overestimated."

        "text": "Although Luhmann first developed his understanding of social systems theory under Parsons' influence, he soon moved away from the Parsonian concept. The most important difference is that Parsons used systems merely as an analytic tool to understand certain processes going on in society; Luhmann, in contrast, treats his vision of systems ontologically, saying that \"systems exist\". That is, Luhmann in fact suggests to substitute the paradigm of systems theory for the ontological paradigm: the difference system/environment (which also signifies a relationship)."

        "text": "Another difference is that Parsons asks how certain subsystems contribute to the functioning of overall society. Luhmann starts with the  differentiation of the systems ([[Differentiation (sociology)]])  themselves out of a nondescript environment. He does observe how certain systems fulfill functions that contribute to \"society\" as a whole, but this is happening more or less by chance, without an overarching vision of society. Finally, the systems' autopoietic closure is another fundamental difference from Parsons' concept. Each system works strictly according to its very own code and has no understanding at all of the way other systems perceive their environment. For example, the economy is all about money, so there is no independent role in the economic system for extraneous aspects such as morals. Upon Luhmann's attempt of defining the relationship value of environment/system we can see a reluctantly atheist approach denying the 'cause' of the creator."

        "text": "One seemingly peculiar, but within the overall framework strictly logical, axiom of Luhmann's theory is the human being's position outside any social system, initially developed by Parsons. Consisting of \"pure communicative actions\" (a reference to [[Jürgen Habermas]]) any social system requires human consciousnesses (personal or psychical systems) as an obviously necessary, but nevertheless environmental resource. In Luhmann's terms, human beings are neither part of society nor of any specific systems, just as they are not part of a conversation. Luhmann himself once said concisely that he was \"not interested in people\". That is not to say that people were not a matter for Luhmann, but rather, the communicative actions of people are constituted (but not defined) by society, and society is constituted (but not defined) by the communicative actions of people: society is people's environment, and people are society's environment. Thus, sociology can explain how persons can change society; the influence of the environment (the people) on the system (the society), the so-called ''\"structural coupling\"''. In fact Luhmann himself replied to the relevant criticism by stating that \"In fact the theory of autopoietic systems could bear the title ''Taking Individuals Seriously'', certainly more seriously than our humanistic tradition\" (Niklas Luhmann, ''Operational Closure and Structural Coupling: The Differentiation of the Legal System'', Cardozo Law Review, vol. 13: 1422). This approach has attracted criticism from those who argue that Luhmann has at no point demonstrated the operational closure of social systems, or in fact that autopoietic social systems actually exist. He has instead taken this as a premise or presupposition, resulting in the logical need to exclude humans from social systems, which prevents the social systems view from accounting for the individual behavior, action, motives, or indeed existence of any individual person.[ Autopoiesis in Organization: Theory and Practice]"
