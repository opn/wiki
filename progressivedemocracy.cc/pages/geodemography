It links the sciences of demography, the study of human population dynamics, geography, the study of the locational and spatial variation of both physical and human phenomena on Earth,[2] and also sociology. In short, geodemography is the study of people based on where they live. Geodemographic systems estimate the most probable characteristics of people based on the pooled profile of all people living in a small area near a particular address.[3] - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodemography wikipedia]"
