        "text": "[[100% Finsbury Park]] is a radio play inspired by the 100% City theatre performances by Rimini Protocol. The radio show will be based on narrative portraits of the views, opinions and life stories of 100 individuals from the local area, based on audio interviews and portrait sittings with local residents.\n\nPerformers will be selected through a “statistical chain reaction”, creating and age, sex, race, and demographic match to form a democratic voice for the area. Portrait sittings will provide a setting for interviews, in which the performers will answer a range of questions posed to them on issues current to the situation facing the community living here. The emphasis will be on creating a candid and authentic voice of the community, refined through a series of workshops that take place throughout the area.\n\nAnonymity will be ensured through the use of stylized portraits and voice actors for sensitive performances. Boal style workshops will be used to encourage participants to bring out strong but representative narratives under the direction of the performer. There are many sensitive issues, and many diverse opinions and faiths represented in our community and the way in which the performers are selected and the workshops organised are designed to provide a safe and compelling forum with which to tell these stories.\n\nAs a serialised radio performance and podcast the show will be performed from a studio which we will create at the Park Theatre, and accompanied by an exhibition of the portraits created to go with the performance. This material will be broadcast on the internet radio station created for the festival, and released as a free podcast on iTunes and the festival website and mobile app we will create for the festival.",
