Consensus may be defined professionally as an acceptable resolution, one that can be supported, even if not the \"favourite\" of each individual. Consensus is defined by Merriam-Webster as, first, general agreement, and second, group solidarity of belief or sentiment. It has its origin in the Latin word cōnsēnsus (agreement), which is from cōnsentiō meaning literally feel together. It is used to describe both the decision and the process of reaching a decision. Consensus decision-making is thus concerned with the process of deliberating and finalizing a decision, and the social, economic, legal, environmental and political effects of applying this process - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making wikipedia]"
