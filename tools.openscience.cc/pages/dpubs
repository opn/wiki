In the 1980s libraries noticed that their journal subscription prices were increasing alarmingly. By the early 1990s, many solutions were being explored, with cancellations being significant among them; in one dramatic case, LSU cancelled $650,000 in subscriptions in 1992-93.  Other alternatives emerged, however, involving the use of new technologies – such as those that enabled Cornell’s digital imaging project – and the increasing availability of the Internet."
