This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries like jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js. TypeScript headers for the Node.js basic modules are also available, allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript."
