Experimentation with various extensions to Lisp (such as LOOPS and Flavors ([[Flavors (programming language)]]) introducing [[multiple inheritance]] and [[mixins]]) eventually led to the [[Common Lisp Object System]], which integrates functional programming and object-oriented programming and allows extension via a [[Meta-object protocol]]. In the 1980s, there were a few attempts to design processor architectures that included hardware support for objects in memory but these were not successful.

Meyer described the Eiffel software development method, based on a small number of key ideas from software engineering and computer science, in [[Object-Oriented Software Construction]]. Essential to the quality focus of Eiffel is Meyer's reliability mechanism, [[Design by Contract]], which is an integral part of both the method and language."

Its dominance was further enhanced by the rising popularity of [[graphical user interface]]s, which rely heavily upon object-oriented programming techniques. An example of a closely related dynamic GUI library and OOP language can be found in the Cocoa ([[Cocoa (software)]]) frameworks on [[Mac OS X]], written in [[Objective-C]], an object-oriented, dynamic messaging extension to C based on Smalltalk.

Each of these two frameworks shows, in its own way, the benefit of using OOP by creating an abstraction from implementation. VB.NET and C# support cross-language inheritance, allowing classes defined in one language to subclass classes defined in the other language."
