For example, [[eigenvector centrality]] uses the [[eigenvectors]] of the [[adjacency matrix]] corresponding to a network, to determine nodes that tend to be frequently visited. Formally established measures of centrality are [[degree centrality]], [[closeness centrality]], [[betweenness centrality]], [[eigenvector centrality]], [[subgraph centrality]] and [[Katz centrality]]. The purpose or objective of analysis generally determines the type of centrality measure to be used. For example, if one is interested in dynamics on networks or the robustness of a network to node/link removal, often the [[dynamical importance]][http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v97/i9/e094102 Characterizing the Dynamical Importance of Network Nodes and Links]  of a node is the most relevant centrality measure.For a centrality measure based on k-core analysis see ref.[ A model of Internet topology using k-shell decomposition]"
