The block was the result of earlier remarks by Prime Minister [[Tayyip Erdogan]] who vowed to \"wipe out Twitter\" following damaging allegations of corruption in his inner circle ([[2013 corruption scandal in Turkey]]). The method became popular after it was determined that a simple domain name block was used to enforce the ban, which would easily be bypassed by using an alternate DNS system. Activists distributed information on how to use the service, and spray-painted the IP addresses used by the service as [[graffiti]] on buildings. Following the discovery of this method, the government moved to directly block Twitter's [[IP address]], and Google Public DNS was blocked entirely.[http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/21/5532522/turkey-twitter-ban-google-dns-workaround Turkish citizens use Google to fight Twitter ban]<ref name=BBCNews-20March2014>[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26677134 \"Twitter website 'blocked' in Turkey\"], ''BBC News'', 20 March 2014.
