More broadly, the term \"design patterns ([[design pattern (computer science)]])\" can be used to refer to any general, repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. Some of these commonly occurring problems have implications and solutions particular to object-oriented development - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Oriented_Programming#Design_patterns wikipedia]"
