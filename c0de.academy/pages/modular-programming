      "text": "A module interface expresses the elements that are provided and required by the module. The elements defined in the interface are detectable by other modules. The implementation contains the working code that corresponds to the elements declared in the interface. Modular programming is closely related to structured programming and object-oriented programming, all having the same goal of facilitating construction of large software programs and systems by decomposition into smaller pieces, and all originating around the 1960s. While historically usage of these terms has been inconsistent, today \"modular programming\" refers to high-level decomposition of the code of an entire program into pieces, structured programming to the low-level code use of structured control flow, and object-oriented programming to the data use of objects, a kind of data structure."
