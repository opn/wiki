This can be achieved by malware that overrides a computer's TCP/IP configuration to point at a rogue DNS server under the control of an attacker, or through modifying the behaviour of a trusted DNS server so that it does not comply with internet standards - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_hijacking wikipedia]"

      "text": "The concern with DNS hijacking involves this hijacking of the NXDOMAIN response. Internet and [[intranet]] applications rely on the NXDOMAIN response to describe the condition where the DNS has no entry for the specified host. If one were to query the invalid domain name (fakeexample.com), one should get an NXDOMAIN response - informing the application that the name is invalid and taking the appropriate action (for example, displaying an error or not attempting to connect to the server). However, if the domain name is queried on one of these non-compliant ISPs, one would always receive a fake IP address belonging to the ISP. In a [[web browser]], this behavior can be annoying or offensive as connections to this IP address display the [[ISP redirect page]] of the provider, sometimes with advertising, instead of a proper error message. However, other applications that rely on the NXDOMAIN error will instead attempt to initiate connections to this spoofed IP address, potentially exposing sensitive information."

Google, among others, run open DNS servers that currently do not return spoofed results.

Website owners may be able to fool some hijackers by using certain DNS settings.  For example, setting a TXT record of \"unused\" on their wildcard address (e.g. *.example.com).  Alternatively, they can try setting the CNAME of the wildcard to \"example.invalid\", making use of the fact that '.invalid' is guaranteed not to exist per the RFC.
