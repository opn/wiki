      "text": "In computing, a stateless protocol is a communications protocol in which no information is retained by either sender or receiver. The sender transmits a packet to the receiver and does not expect an acknowledgment of receipt. A UDP connection-oriented session is a stateless connection because neither systems maintains information about the session during its life - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_protocol wikipedia]"

      "text": "A stateless protocol does not require the server to retain session information or status about each communications partner for the duration of multiple requests. In contrast, a protocol that requires keeping of the internal state on the server is known as a stateful protocol. A TCP connection-oriented session is a 'stateful' connection because both systems maintain information about the session itself during its life."

      "text": "The stateless design simplifies the server design because there is no need to dynamically allocate storage to deal with conversations in progress. If a client session dies in mid-transaction, no part of the system needs to be responsible for cleaning up the present state of the server. A disadvantage of statelessness is that it may be necessary to include additional information in every request, and this extra information will need to be interpreted by the server."
