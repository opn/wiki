Therefore the key question is more about how to introduce it to the world in the best possible manner so that the risk of misuse is avoided as much as possible. This is the approach that we consider the best:\n\nFirst, we want to raise public awareness to make people realize that the technology exists by releasing audio samples from the digital voices of Donald Trump and Barack Obama.\nSecond, we want to ensure that your digital voice is yours. We are stewards of your voice, but you control its usage: no one can use it without your explicit consent.\nImagine that we had decided not to release this technology at all. Others would develop it and who knows if their intentions would be as sincere as ours: they could, for example, only sell the technology to a specific company or an ill-intentioned organization. By contrast, we are making the technology available to anyone and we are introducing it incrementally so that society can adapt to it, leverage its positive aspects for good, while preventing potentially negative applications."
