Freedom to use the work itself. This is the most basic thing a free content license allows: when you get a copy of a work under one of these licenses, you can use it however you want.

(This is why the NC licenses aren‚Äôt considered licenses for Free Cultural Works.)\n 2. Freedom to use the information in the work for any purpose. In addition to being able to simply share a free cultural work, you should also be able to use the information it contains. For example, if it‚Äôs a research paper or educational course, you should be able to build on it for your own research and teaching.
