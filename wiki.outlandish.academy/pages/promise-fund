These videos are cryptographically signed using robust identities provided by an implementation of the WC3 Identity group, and added to a permanent decentralised open source storage system called IPFS.\n\nThese promises are permanently linked to this identity, and time stamped using a custom modification of open source software called the Eternity Wall, which enters a hash that proves the association between the promise and the user at the given time. \n\nOur software accesses this transparent ledger of pseudo-anonymous users and transactions to display the promises and time balances. As a user earns time credits they are able to redeem their pledges at which point they are marked ad fulfilled. \n\nThe blockchain is a globally accessible secure and verifiable ledger. This forms the basis of a new and important form of reputation, which can be used by individuals, to potential employers as it is not forgeable, and to funders."

The next stage is to integrate these three components."

Community currencies, and crypto-currencies such as bitcoin, are growing in popularity rapidly. however their popularity is limited by the inability to associate your time balances with your won portable identity, in an increasingly mobile world.\n\nOur experience developing the P2P education platform for the Viral Academy, both with focus groups online, in Italy, Germany, Sweden and the UK, informed the design of the current proposal.\n\nAdditionally, in interviews with online community projects, such as EdgeRyders, Ouishare, NextEdge, and physical spaces such as hacklabs, makerlabs and fablabs, there was a clear expressed need to use a community currency within their communities.\n\nFinally at conferences, and in follow up, we discussed the needs of open source projects, and over half those interviewed were interested in volunteering time to promote and manage a wider community involvement in their projects. \n\nA particular concern that our project addresses is not to lose the community and voluntary feel of the projects. The use of pledges is appealing as it acts both as an endorsement and mitigates the \"counting\" or inhuman aspects of bank balances and spread sheets."

The use of the blockchain to create a more robust provable time based currency will facilitate exchanges online and between users in different countries."

These videos are cryptographically signed using robust identities provided by an implementation of the WC3 Identity group, and added to a permanent decentralised open source storage system called IPFS.\n\nThese promises are permanently linked to this identity, and time stamped using a custom modification of open source software called the Eternity Wall, which enters a hash that proves the association between the promise and the user at the given time. \n\nOur software accesses this transparent ledger of pseudo-anonymous users and transactions to display the promises and time balances. As a user earns time credits they are able to redeem their pledges at which point they are marked ad fulfilled. \n\nThe blockchain is a globally accessible secure and verifiable ledger. This forms the basis of a new and important form of reputation, which can be used by individuals, to potential employers as it is not forgeable, and to funders."

The use of pledges is appealing as it acts both as an endorsement and mitigates the \"counting\" or inhuman aspects of bank balances and spread sheets."
