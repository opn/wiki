It is the most popular game in history, with a surprisingly wide demographic.\n\nWe presented the idea for the game in a school in a rural area of the South of France and in Southern Italy. Over 70% of students raised their hands indicating they played the game, and the response from pupils and teachers was phenomenal.\n\nWe have contacts at Microsoft (who own Minecraft and run Minecon in London each year), and together with the support of our project partners at the British Library, and key organisations within the Minecraft community, we will be able to relatively easily reach our intended audience.\n\nMinecraft is an excellent vehicle to teach coding using scripting extensions on the server, and we will be creating an educational package based around a Raspberry Pi 2. We will be extending this aspect of the project and working with schools and organisations promoting the teaching of coding, and the Raspberry Pi Foundation.\n\nWorking with media organisations and international museums currently organising events we expect the competition to be wildly popular."

We expect schools teaching citizenship, history, architecture, communities interested in the environment, the circular economy, alternative currencies and economic models, and democratic structures - all to find the project to be interesting for their own educational purposes.\n\nCompetition entries will be expected to come from mixed teams, with contributions in text, sketching and video forming part of the process."

It is the most popular game in history, with a surprisingly wide demographic.\n\nWe presented the idea for the game in a school in a rural area of the South of France and in Southern Italy. Over 70% of students raised their hands indicating they played the game, and the response from pupils and teachers was phenomenal.\n\nWe have contacts at Microsoft (who own Minecraft and run Minecon in London each year), and together with the support of our project partners at the British Library, and key organisations within the Minecraft community, we will be able to relatively easily reach our intended audience.\n\nMinecraft is an excellent vehicle to teach coding using scripting extensions on the server, and we will be creating an educational package based around a Raspberry Pi 2. We will be extending this aspect of the project and working with schools and organisations promoting the teaching of coding, and the Raspberry Pi Foundation.\n\nWorking with media organisations and international museums currently organising events we expect the competition to be wildly popular."

We expect schools teaching citizenship, history, architecture, communities interested in the environment, the circular economy, alternative currencies and economic models, and democratic structures - all to find the project to be interesting for their own educational purposes.\n\nCompetition entries will be expected to come from mixed teams, with contributions in text, sketching and video forming part of the process."
