Its main feature is provocativeness and mockery while being formally polite. Historically, Kaschenist style uses many words and idioms of Jewish origin; and in conversations, Kashenists often pretend to be Jews, in order to troll anti-Semites while also causing others to make excuses to prove that they are not anti-Semites. Kaschenist style also typically uses medical terms, especially from psychiatry; this is because Kaschenists consider themselves jocularly as \"network psychiatrists\", and imitate either medical staff or, conversely, patients in a mental hospital. The word Kaschenism also denotes a philosophy of people who use Kaschenist style in electronic conversations.\n"
