The family business was started by Fred C. Koch, who developed a new cracking method for the refinement of heavy crude oil into gasoline. Fred's four sons litigated against each other over their interests in the business during the 1980s and 1990s - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_family wikipedia]"
