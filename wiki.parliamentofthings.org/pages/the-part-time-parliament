We found the protocol a bit difficult to understand and therefore abandoned our attempts at implementing it.  \n<p>\nAt around this time, Mike Schroeder told us about a protocol for consensus that Leslie Lamport had invented and suggested we ask him about it.  Leslie gave Ed a copy of the Part-Time Parliament tech report, which we both enjoyed reading.  \n<p>\nI particularly liked its humour and to this day, cannot understand why people don't like that tech report.  Paxos had all the necessary properties we wanted for our system and we figured we could implement it.  Leslie provided essential consulting help as well, which resulted in the first implementation of the Paxos algorithm (including dynamic reconfiguration) as far as I am aware.\n<p>\nA year later, when we needed a distributed lock server for the Frangipani file system we used Paxos again. \n</blockquote>"
