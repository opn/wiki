[...] With respect to causation, this has the consequence that the “winning” cause-effect structure excludes alternative cause-effect structures specified over overlapping elements, otherwise there would be causal overdetermination. [...] The exclusion postulate can be said to enforce Occam’s razor (entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity): it is more parsimonious to postulate the existence of a single cause-effect structure over a system of elements—the one that is maximally irreducible from the system’s intrinsic perspective—than a multitude of overlapping cause-effect structures whose existence would make no further difference. The exclusion postulate also applies to individual mechanisms: a subset of elements in a state specifies the cause-effect repertoire that is maximally irreducible (MICE ([[#MICE]])) within the system (<math display=\"inline\">\\Phi^{\\textrm{Max}}</math>), called a core concept, or concept ([[#Concept]]) for short. Again, it cannot additionally specify a cause-effect repertoire overlapping over the same elements, because otherwise the difference a mechanism makes would be counted multiple times. [...] Finally, the exclusion postulate also applies to spatio-temporal grains, implying that a conceptual structure is specified over a definite grain size in space (either quarks, atoms, neurons, neuronal groups, brain areas, and so on) and time (either microseconds, milliseconds, seconds, minutes, and so on), the one at which <math display=\"inline\">\\Phi</math> reaches a maximum. [...]  Once more, this implies that a mechanism cannot specify a cause-effect repertoire at a particular temporal grain, and additional effects at a finer or coarser grain, otherwise the differences a mechanism makes would be counted multiple times."

[...] With respect to causation, this has the consequence that the “winning” cause-effect structure excludes alternative cause-effect structures specified over overlapping elements, otherwise there would be causal overdetermination. [...] The exclusion postulate can be said to enforce Occam’s razor (entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity): it is more parsimonious to postulate the existence of a single cause-effect structure over a system of elements—the one that is maximally irreducible from the system’s intrinsic perspective—than a multitude of overlapping cause-effect structures whose existence would make no further difference. The exclusion postulate also applies to individual mechanisms: a subset of elements in a state specifies the cause-effect repertoire that is maximally irreducible (MICE ([[#MICE]])) within the system (<math display=\"inline\">\\Phi^{\\textrm{Max}}</math>), called a core concept, or concept ([[#Concept]]) for short. Again, it cannot additionally specify a cause-effect repertoire overlapping over the same elements, because otherwise the difference a mechanism makes would be counted multiple times. [...] Finally, the exclusion postulate also applies to spatio-temporal grains, implying that a conceptual structure is specified over a definite grain size in space (either quarks, atoms, neurons, neuronal groups, brain areas, and so on) and time (either microseconds, milliseconds, seconds, minutes, and so on), the one at which <math display=\"inline\">\\Phi</math> reaches a maximum. [...]  Once more, this implies that a mechanism cannot specify a cause-effect repertoire at a particular temporal grain, and additional effects at a finer or coarser grain, otherwise the differences a mechanism makes would be counted multiple times."
