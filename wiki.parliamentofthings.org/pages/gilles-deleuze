        "text": "Deleuze's main philosophical project in the works he wrote prior to his collaborations with Guattari can be baldly summarized as an inversion of the traditional metaphysical ([[metaphysics]]) relationship between identity ([[Identity (philosophy)]]) and difference ([[Difference (philosophy)]]). Traditionally, difference is seen as derivative from identity: e.g., to say that \"X is different from Y\" assumes some X and Y with at least relatively stable identities (as in Plato's forms). To the contrary, Deleuze claims that all identities are effects of difference. Identities are neither logically nor metaphysically prior to difference, Deleuze argues, \"given that there exist differences of nature between things of the same genus.\" That is, not only are no two things ever the same, the categories we use to identify individuals in the first place derive from differences. Apparent identities such as \"X\" are composed of endless series of differences, where \"X\" = \"the difference between x and x'\", and \"x'\" = \"the difference between...\", and so forth. Difference, in other words, goes all the way down. To confront reality honestly, Deleuze argues, we must grasp beings exactly as they are, and concepts of identity (forms, categories, resemblances, unities of apperception, predicates, etc.) fail to attain what he calls \"difference in itself.\" \"If philosophy has a positive and direct relation to things, it is only insofar as philosophy claims to grasp the thing itself, according to what it is, in its difference from everything it is not, in other words, in its ''internal difference''.\""

        "text": "Like Kant and Bergson, Deleuze considers traditional notions of space and time as unifying forms imposed by the subject ([[subject (philosophy)]]). He therefore concludes that pure difference is non-spatio-temporal; it is an idea, what Deleuze calls \"the virtual\". (The coinage refers to Proust's definition of what is constant in both the past and the present: \"real without being actual, ideal without being abstract.\") While Deleuze's virtual ideas superficially resemble [[Plato]]'s forms and Kant's ideas of pure reason, they are not originals or models, nor do they transcend possible experience; instead they are the conditions of actual experience, the internal difference in itself. \"The concept they [the conditions] form is identical to its object.\" A Deleuzean idea or concept of difference is therefore not a wraith-like abstraction of an experienced thing, it is a real system of differential relations that creates actual spaces, times, and sensations."

        "text": "Thus, Deleuze at times refers to his philosophy as a '''transcendental empiricism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (''empirisme transcendantal''), alluding to Kant and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]. In Kant's [[transcendental idealism]], experience only makes sense when organized by forms of sensibility (namely, space and time) and intellectual categories (such as causality). Assuming the content of these forms and categories to be qualities of the world as it exists independently of our perceptual access, according to Kant, spawns seductive but senseless metaphysical beliefs (for example, extending the concept of causality beyond possible experience results in unverifiable speculation about a first cause). Deleuze inverts the Kantian arrangement: experience exceeds our concepts by presenting novelty, and this raw experience of difference actualizes an idea, unfettered by our prior categories, forcing us to invent new ways of thinking (see below, ''Epistemology ([[#Epistemology]])'')."

Deleuze borrows the doctrine of ''[[ontological]] [[univocity]]'' from the medieval philosopher John Duns Scotus ([[Duns Scotus]]). In medieval disputes over the nature of God, many eminent theologians and philosophers (such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]) held that when one says that \"God is good\", God's goodness is only analogous to human goodness. Scotus argued to the contrary that when one says that \"God is good\", the goodness in question is exactly the same sort of goodness that is meant when one says \"Jane is good\". That is, God only differs from us in degree, and properties such as goodness ([[good and evil]]), power ([[Power (philosophy)]]), [[reason]], and so forth are univocally applied, regardless of whether one is talking about God, a person, or a flea."

Moreover, it is not we who are univocal in a Being which is not; it is we and our individuality which remains equivocal in and for a univocal Being.\" Here Deleuze at once echoes and inverts Spinoza, who maintained that everything that exists is a modification of the one substance ([[substance theory]]), [[God]] or [[Nature]]. For Deleuze, there is no one substance, only an always-differentiating process ([[process philosophy]]), an origami cosmos, always folding, unfolding, refolding. Deleuze summarizes this ontology in the paradoxical formula \"pluralism ([[pluralism (philosophy)]]) = [[monism]]\"."

This work expands upon other scholars’ previous works to comment on the state of society in the 1990s, which saw transformations due to technological and social developments. For Deleuze, society no longer existed as the disciplinary societies Foucault discussed, which monitors itself based on authoritative presence, or perceived presence, within enclosed spaces.  Rather, Deleuze suggests that new technologies and institutional reform have created a society that constantly monitors itself, regardless of location."

        "text": "Deleuze argues that enclosures of control, such as prisons, schools, and corporations, previously enabled a disciplinary society.  However, he notes that these institutions undergo constant states of transition and reform.  Deleuze suggests that these reforms create an environment that enables societies of control, because they are increasingly expanding their presence within the lives of the individual.  These developments of social structures, in conjunction with technological advancements and the ever-growing capitalistic system, have created a perception that individuals can no longer entirely escape the presence of an authority’s control.  Deleuze implies that physical enclosures do not define the space that enables an authoritative figures’ control over the individual.  Instead, these enclosures of control are becoming modulations of control that move with the individual. He suggests that authoritative figures are now able to exert their control over individuals irrespective of their physical location.  This unrestricted access to the masses inherently causes individuals to monitor their actions based on perceived controls. Deleuze’s work on this topic has been adopted by members of the technological community as a means to critique the role of technologies within the lives of the masses.[http://www.jstor.org/stable/778828 .

In a classical liberal ([[Classical liberalism]]) model of society, morality begins from individuals, who bear abstract [[natural rights]] or duties set by themselves or a God. Following his rejection of any metaphysics based on identity, Deleuze criticizes the notion of an individual as an arresting or halting of differentiation (as the etymology of the word \"individual\" suggests). Guided by the naturalistic ethics ([[Ethical naturalism]]) of Spinoza and Nietzsche, Deleuze instead seeks to understand individuals and their moralities as products of the organization of pre-individual desires and powers. In the two volumes of ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'', Deleuze and Guattari describe history as a congealing and regimentation of \"[[desiring-production]]\" (a concept combining features of Freudian ([[Sigmund Freud]]) drives and Marxist ([[Marxism]]) labor ([[Labour economics]])) into the modern individual (typically neurotic and repressed), the nation-state (a society of continuous control), and [[capitalism]] (an anarchy domesticated into infantilizing commodification). Deleuze, following [[Karl Marx]], welcomes capitalism's destruction of traditional social hierarchies as liberating, but inveighs against its homogenization of all values to the aims of the market."
