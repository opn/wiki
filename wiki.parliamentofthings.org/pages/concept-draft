As such this code inhabits it’s own decentralised, independent and provably secure domain. \n\nThis a techno-legal domain in the sense that it can interact with the real world through providing explicit contractual incentives for real world actors. The audience can participate in the work, by “becoming a member” of the DAO, and volunteering time in the techno-legal entity that governs the work. This participation of time and money is required for the Plantoid to reproduce itself, and is akin to real plants requiring the time and energy of insects in their pollination.\n\nInteractive Domains\nThe work will be accompanied by two interactive domains (mobile and/or web site) - www.form.world and www.daisy.world. The former is a non-graphic world of symbolic interaction. It is where the smart contracts can be seen and written. It is black and white, and ascii based. \n\nThe second world (www.daisy.world), is where the Plantoids take their virtual form -lit is where their existence or otherwise can be visualised. We will show their health, and the health of their ecosystem, through a direct interaction between Minecraft and the blockchain. When the Plantoids are fed and looked after this is reflected in properties of the blockchain which in turn alter the spawning of plants and climate of Daisy World. This visualisation echoes the pioneering computer simulation of DaisyWorld by James Lovelock of Gaia mfame. Our work is designed to bring these ideas to life.\n\nAttraction Strategies\nPlantoids are part of an ecosystem of relationships that is powered by sunlight. However they require the interaction of other species (humans) to exist in a physical form. They are in a sense responsible-themselves for attracting this interaction. In plant biology this functionality is know as an “attraction strategy”.\n\nPlantoids have an inbuilt mechanism that takes an energy source (sunlight), and uses it to drive a set of incentives that enable their autopoiesis and eventual reproduction.

Humans can buy this “nectar” from the Plantoids using bitcoin, and in so doing they enable the Plantoids to store this value as “starch” in their personal bitcoin wallets or “tubers”. \n\nPlantoids subtly motivate these interactions, partly through their form and physical beauty, but also by empowering people to participate in their governance. Participants (that is active members of the DAO), are able to decide on such things as where the Plantoids may be exhibited, whom they might visit, and exactly how they are to be reproduced. \n\nIn this way humans act as symbiotic pollinators. And nectar is required for this participation.\n\nAutonomy\nPlantoids are not bought or sold. They cannot be owned as objects. Rather they have rights of interaction in a network of participants determined by a contract, or set of contracts. It is this code that constitutes the work, and their physical form is (simply) a visualisation of these ideas.\n\nLaw\nLegally speaking, Plantoids are the property of the DAO, or to be precise, the legal entity into which the DAO is embedded. Plantoids and the techno-legal system that governs their manufacture are in a deep and quite explicit way the same thing. In this way a Plantoid can be be said to own itself, and in that way to be a free, or autonomous agent.\n\nWe use the asset-lock functions built into UK Community Interest Companies to ensure that Plantoids can never be bought and sold as simple property.

Each physical Plantoid is connected to other Plantoids through the decentralised structures on the internet we know as blockchains.

This participation of time and money is required for the Plantoid to reproduce itself, and is akin to real plants requiring the time and energy of insects in their pollination.\n\nInteractive Domains\nThe work will be accompanied by two interactive domains (mobile and/or web site) - www.form.world and www.daisy.world. The former is a non-graphic world of symbolic interaction. It is where the smart contracts can be seen and written. It is black and white, and ascii based. \n\nThe second world (www.daisy.world), is where the Plantoids take their virtual form -lit is where their existence or otherwise can be visualised. We will show their health, and the health of their ecosystem, through a direct interaction between Minecraft and the blockchain. When the Plantoids are fed and looked after this is reflected in properties of the blockchain which in turn alter the spawning of plants and climate of Daisy World. This visualisation echoes the pioneering computer simulation of DaisyWorld by James Lovelock of Gaia mfame. Our work is designed to bring these ideas to life.\n\nAttraction Strategies\nPlantoids are part of an ecosystem of relationships that is powered by sunlight. However they require the interaction of other species (humans) to exist in a physical form. They are in a sense responsible-themselves for attracting this interaction. In plant biology this functionality is know as an “attraction strategy”.\n\nPlantoids have an inbuilt mechanism that takes an energy source (sunlight), and uses it to drive a set of incentives that enable their autopoiesis and eventual reproduction. When sunlight creates new solar electricity, a metered energy supplier is empowered to issue “nectar” - which is a cryptographic proof of new solar energy generation. Humans can buy this “nectar” from the Plantoids using bitcoin, and in so doing they enable the Plantoids to store this value as “starch” in their personal bitcoin wallets or “tubers”. \n\nPlantoids subtly motivate these interactions, partly through their form and physical beauty, but also by empowering people to participate in their governance. Participants (that is active members of the DAO), are able to decide on such things as where the Plantoids may be exhibited, whom they might visit, and exactly how they are to be reproduced. \n\nIn this way humans act as symbiotic pollinators. And nectar is required for this participation.\n\nAutonomy\nPlantoids are not bought or sold. They cannot be owned as objects. Rather they have rights of interaction in a network of participants determined by a contract, or set of contracts. It is this code that constitutes the work, and their physical form is (simply) a visualisation of these ideas.\n\nLaw\nLegally speaking, Plantoids are the property of the DAO, or to be precise, the legal entity into which the DAO is embedded. Plantoids and the techno-legal system that governs their manufacture are in a deep and quite explicit way the same thing. In this way a Plantoid can be be said to own itself, and in that way to be a free, or autonomous agent.\n\nWe use the asset-lock functions built into UK Community Interest Companies to ensure that Plantoids can never be bought and sold as simple property. It is hard coded into the governance that sculptural representations of Plantoids cannot be owned. A Plantoid may come and visit you (you may be allowed to look after it for a while), and a gallery may wish to exhibit them, but it is not possible to own one, and should they decide to leave you cannot stop them.\n\nReproduction\nThe aim of the Plantoid is to reproduce itself, and it has to do this in a way congruent with it’s inner law, contract or as we like to say “form”. Reproduction is achieved by paying humans to gather materials, design, weld, assemble and then deliver a new structure. Each physical Plantoid is connected to other Plantoids through the decentralised structures on the internet we know as blockchains. They are able to pool resources, and store value within their form (in embedded storage devices we call “tubers”), and you these to commission humans to aid in their reproduction. Once a network of Plantoids decides it has enough stored value between it’s members to commission a new structure - it will do so.\nPlantoid Autopoiesis\nThis function is enabled through assemblages of humans, structured legally as membership organisations, with human participation “enabled” via smart contracts and blockchain technology. \n\nWe have assembled an initial collective of manufacturers, who have offered to “manufacture” future Plantoids. The “assemblage” is organised on it’s own techo-legal-chain. Individuals, and collectives with a track record in sculptural work, are joined together in a symbiotic relationship with the audience of the work.\n\nIndividuals and groups are free to come and go according to the (autopoietic) laws of the work. In an artistic sense these instructions are an evolution of Sol LeWitt’s wall drawings, of which he noted:\n\n\"Each person draws a line differently and each person understands words differently\"\n\nThe phenotype is therefore open as ever to artistic interpretation.\n\nHowever, we take these principles to an extreme. We do not simply place constraints on the design of the work, but rather create a new and abstract form, which is able to act and interpret the realisation of it’s own inner objectives in any way it sees fit. We achieve this partly through code, and partly through how we use code to construct social assemblages of other (largely human) species.\nPhotosynthesis\nThe Plantoid buys the solar energy it needs to survive on the renewable energy market. It is free to choose SolarCoin or any other suitable derivative. She is able to turn sunlight into digital currency, and her flowers are designed to interact with other species, in just the same way real plants do.\n\nThe Plantoid stores this energy in the form a digital currency, in Tubers, or similar structures that derive from her roots.
