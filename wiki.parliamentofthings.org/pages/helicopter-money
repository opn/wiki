[[Ben Bernanke]] famously delivered a speech on preventing deflation in November 2002 as a Federal Reserve Board governor, where he says that Keynes \"once semi-seriously proposed, as an anti-deflationary measure, that the government fill bottles with currency and bury them in mine shafts to be dug up by the public.\" In that speech, Bernanke himself says, \"a money-financed tax cut is essentially equivalent to Milton Friedman's famous 'helicopter drop' of money.\" [https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/Speeches/2002/20021121/default.htm#f8 Speech, Bernanke --Deflation-- November 21, 2002] In a footnote to that speech, Bernanke also references an important paper by Gauti Eggertson which emphasises the importance of a commitment from the central bank to keep the money supply at a higher level in the future. The Irish economist, [[Eric Lonergan]], also argued in 2002 in the ''Financial Times'', that central banks consider cash transfers to households as an alternative to further reductions in interest rates, also on the grounds of financial stability. In 2003, [[Willem Buiter]], then chief economist at the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]],  revived the concept of helicopter money in a theoretical paper, arguing that base money is not a liability, which provides a more rigorous case for Friedman and Haberler's Pigouvian intuitions."
