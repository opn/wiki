Otherwise, the intelligence says 'haven't a clue'. If offered a plan with too high-level sub-goals, the behavior-system again asks <b>how</b> for the foremost sub-goal, repeating the question until it receives details that are low-enough level to send signals to actuators in a particular order... i.e. a 'program'. Then it begins to actualize the plan. Meanwhile, the behavior-system must continue observing the world and checking to see if the current plan must be revised (which can be optimized; test 'does this plan still approach that goal' or, better, set up the knowledge-system to automatically recognize and report any discovered patterns counter-indicate current, future, and ongoing plans).

The use of emotions to introduce useful desires can do much to ease the burden on commanders of the artificial-intelligence systems because they'll automatically handle the small stuff... e.g. ensuring that they remain well-fueled, pumping time into data-processing and study during off-hours, choosing solutions that avoid damage to their systems, breaking pesky rules to save lives when the action is <i>necessary</i> (based on irritation), following rules like avoiding harm to others or telling others secrets because they'd feel associated 'guilt', etc.",
