In tournament species, most members of the competing sex never win the competitions and never mate, but almost all members of the other sex do mate with the small group of winners."

Thus, most tournament species have high [[sexual dimorphism]].  Examples of tournament species include [[grouse]], [[peafowl]], [[lion]]s, [[mountain gorilla]]s and [[elephant seal]]s."

In all these cases, the female of the species shows traits that help in same-sex battles: larger bodies, aggressiveness, territorialism.  Even maintenance of a multiple-male \"harem\" is sometimes seen in these animals."
