Where thought has opened up one cell of reality, it should, without violence by the subject, penetrate the next. It proves its relation to the object as soon as other objects crystallize around it. In the light it casts on its chosen substance, others begin to glow.[http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/z/adornoonwriting.html source]"

        "text": "I am writing this page in response to the [[Dissertation Over Discourse]] page. It is not a value-neutral \"preference\". I feel it is a little hegemonic, in a way, because even though \"dissertation\" is reached via collaboration, it still emphasizes the hierarchical relationship between knowledge (higher) and dialogue about knowledge (lower). I suggest this might be a gender preference. As a woman, I prefer discourse over dissertation any time.
