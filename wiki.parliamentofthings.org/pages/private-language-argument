        "text": "If someone were to behave as if they understood a language which no-one else can make sense of, we might call this an example of a private language. It is not sufficient here, however, for the language to simply be one that has not yet been translated. In order to count as a ''private language'' in Wittgenstein's sense, it must be in principle incapable of translation into an ordinary language - if for example it were to describe those inner experiences supposed to be inaccessible to others. The private language being considered is not simply a language ''in fact'' understood by one person, but a language that ''in principle'' can only be understood by one person. So the last speaker of a dying language would not be speaking a private language, since the language remains in principle learnable. A private language must be unlearnable and untranslatable, and yet it must appear that the speaker is able to make sense of it - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_language_argument#What_a_private_language_is wikipedia]"

Locke is also a prominent exponent of the view targeted by the argument, since he proposed in his An Essay Concerning Human Understanding that the referent of a word is the idea it stands for."

      "text": "If someone were to behave as if they understood a language which no-one else can make sense of, we might call this an example of a private language. It is not sufficient here, however, for the language to simply be one that has not yet been translated. In order to count as a ''private language'' in Wittgenstein's sense, it must be in principle incapable of translation into an ordinary language - if for example it were to describe those inner experiences supposed to be inaccessible to others. The private language being considered is not simply a language ''in fact'' understood by one person, but a language that ''in principle'' can only be understood by one person. So the last speaker of a dying language would not be speaking a private language, since the language remains in principle learnable. A private language must be unlearnable and untranslatable, and yet it must appear that the speaker is able to make sense of it - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_language_argument#What_a_private_language_is wikipedia]"
