Thus, there is no sewage system ([[Sewage collection and disposal]]), [[drinking water]] must be bought from vendors or carried from a nearby tap, and if there is electricity, it is stolen from a passing cable."

Many buildings, particularly in the [[inner city]] of [[Johannesburg]] have also been occupied by squatters. Property owners or government authorities can usually evict squatters after following certain legal procedures including requesting a court order. In [[Durban]], the city council routinely evicts without a court order in defiance of the law, and there has been sustained conflict between the city council and a shack dwellers' movement known as [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]]. There has been a number of similar conflicts between shack dwellers, some linked with the [[Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign]], and the city council in [[Cape Town]]. One of the most high-profile cases was the brutal evictions of squatters in the [[N2 Gateway]] homes in the suburb of Delft ([[Delft, Cape Town]]), where over 20 residents were shot, including a three-year-old child. There have been numerous complaints about the legality of the government's actions and, in particular, whether the ruling of the judge was unfair given his party affiliations and the highly politicized nature of the case.[http://westerncapeantieviction.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/joeslovo_delft-leggasick.pdf Western Cape Housing Crisis: Writings on Joe Slovo and Delft] Many of the families are now squatting on [[Symphony Way]], a main road in the township of Delft.

The ''okupa'' movement represents a highly politicized form of squatting, so much so that participants often claim they live in squats as a form of political protest first and foremost.[http://www.casa.manifestor.org/static_pages/participants2005.htm#Miguel%20Mart%EDnez%20Lopez CASA Participants 2005] The movement is involved in various other social struggles, including the [[alter-globalization]] movement. In 1996, during [[José María Aznar]]'s presidency, the first specific legislation against squatting was passed and became the prelude to many squat evictions. In the barrio of [[Lavapiés]] in [[Madrid]], the [[Eskalera Karakola]] was a feminist ([[Feminism]]) self-managed squat, which was active from 1996 to 2005 and participated in the nextGENDERation network.[http://www.nextgenderation.net/ nextGENDERation network] Other examples are the Escuela Popular de Prosperidad ([[La Prospe]]) o Minuesa."

Since Mexican laws establish that an individual may take legal possession of a property after five to twenty years of peaceful occupation, many ''paracaidistas'' establish themselves with the hope that the legal owner will not discover them and expel them before five years.

The council voted to allow the squatters to stay in the building, which they called Iceland, until the plans for demolition were in place. One of the squatters said, \"About 20 people have lived here over the years and it's been a place for band rehearsals, art projects, people practising dance routines, bike workshops. Squatting gives you a chance to think about things other than how you are going to pay the rent and ways to contribute to the world.\"[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/squatters-out-as-bulldozers-start-engines/2008/05/04/1209839456289.html Creagh, Sunanda ''Squatters out as bulldozer start engines'']"

Social centers are often a combination of many things that happen in one space with the aim of creating a space for people to meet in a non-commercial setting, whether it be for a party, political workshop, to see a film, have a drink or have breakfast. There are many squatted social centers around the world, but they exist mainly in countries where squatting is legal. Examples include [[Ernst-Kirchweger-Haus]] in Austria, the [[RampART Social Centre]] in England, [[OT301]] in the Netherlands and [[Ungdomshuset]] in [[Denmark]] (evicted on March 1, 2007, and demolished four days later)."
