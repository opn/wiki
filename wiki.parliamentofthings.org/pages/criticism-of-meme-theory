      "text": "An objection to the study of the evolution of memes in genetic terms (although not to the existence of memes) involves a perceived gap in the gene/meme analogy: the cumulative evolution of genes depends on biological selection-pressures neither too great nor too small in relation to mutation-rates. There seems no reason to think that the same balance will exist in the selection pressures on memes.<ref> p.333 - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme#Criticism_of_meme_theory wikipedia]"

As a factual criticism, Benitez-Bribiesca points to the lack of a \"code script\" for memes (analogous to the DNA of genes), and to the excessive instability of the meme mutation mechanism (that of an idea going from one brain to another), which would lead to a low replication accuracy and a high mutation rate, rendering the evolutionary process chaotic."
