They point out that many cases in adversarial systems, and most cases in the United States, are actually resolved by [[plea bargain]] or settlement ([[Settlement (litigation)]]). Plea bargain as a system does not exist in an inquisitorial system. Many legal cases in adversarial systems, and most in the United States, do not go to trial, which may lead to injustice when the defendant has an unskilled or overworked attorney, which is likely to be the case when the defendant is poor. In addition, proponents of inquisitorial systems argue that the plea bargain system causes the participants in the system to act in perverse ways, in that it encourages prosecutors to bring charges far in excess of what is warranted and defendants to plead guilty even when they believe that they are not."

      "text": "The exclusionary rule is a legal principle in the United States, under constitutional law, which holds that evidence collected or analyzed in violation of the defendant's constitutional rights is sometimes inadmissible for a criminal prosecution in a court of law. This may be considered an example of a prophylactic rule formulated by the judiciary in order to protect a constitutional right. The exclusionary rule may also, in some circumstances at least, be considered to follow directly from the constitutional language, such as the Fifth Amendment's command that no person \"shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself\" and that no person \"shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law\" - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusionary_rule wikipedia]"

In general parallel thinking is a further development of the well known lateral thinking processes, focusing even more on explorations—looking for what can be rather than for what is - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_thinking wikipedia]"
