Isomerisation is another common example, where higher energy isomers are long lived as they are prevented from rearranging to the ground state by (possibly large) barriers in the potential energy."

The abundance of states is more prevalent as the systems grow larger and/or if the forces of their mutual interaction are spatially less uniform or more diverse."

Here the equivalent of the thermal fluctuations is the \"white noise\" affecting the signal propagation and the decision-making."
