In planning, the charrette has become a technique for consulting with all stakeholders ([[Project stakeholder]]).  This type of charrette (sometimes called an enquiry by design) typically involves intense and possibly multi-day meetings, involving [[municipal]] officials, developer ([[real estate developer]])s, and residents.  A successful charrette promotes joint ownership of solutions and attempts to defuse typical confrontational attitudes between residents and developers.  Charrettes tend to involve small groups, however the residents participating  may not represent all the residents nor have the [[moral authority]] to represent them.  Residents who do participate get early input into the planning process.   For developers and municipal officials charrettes achieve community involvement, may satisfy consultation ([[Public consultation]]) criteria, with the objective of avoiding costly legal battles.  Other uses of the term \"charrette\" occur within an academic or [[profession]]al setting, whereas urban planners invite the general public to their planning charrettes.  Thus most people (unless they happen to be design students) encounter the term \"charrette\" in an urban-planning context - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charrette#Specific_cases_of_charrette wikipedia]"
