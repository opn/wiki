I don't feel that art is distinct in any essential way from other forms of creative work, whether it is product design, science or mathematics. Rather it is negatively designed in terms of it's business model, a form of social trickery, that creates a space for some fantastic and vital experiments. Art is a way to get stupid people to have interesting thoughts (and to pay for them)."
