RV has a structured, very packed and <i>proprietary</i> format that it uses to send data from publisher to subscriber.  We had to create a hidden window where the RV API would post all updates for all subjects we were listening on. To use the RV API directly was a big pain, and the [[Tib Msg]] API made it slightly easier, but the Market Data API made things even easier.

RV has a structured, very packed and <i>proprietary</i> format that it uses to send data from publisher to subscriber.  We had to create a hidden window where the RV API would post all updates for all subjects we were listening on.
