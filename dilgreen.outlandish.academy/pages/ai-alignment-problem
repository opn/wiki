Since AI is explicitly an effort to build some analogue of human-style intelligence, and since human-style intelligence is impossible to tease apart from human culture, any attempt to characterise AI research without attempting an understanding of the human-cultural aspects of the 'AI community' is likely to be inadequate."

It will make sense to specify their usage here more tightly.\n\n#### Complexity\n- Complex dynamic systems are present in many biosphere environments and instantiations (most obviously living creatures) from the micro to the macro, and are increasingly observed and identified in systems which have been developed as a result of human action.\n- Such systems exhibit a set of characteristics which we will describe as 'Complexity'.\n- The fundamental characteristic is a high degree of internal interaction of a recursive nature (usually over time, but also over space).\n- From this fundamental character arise other characteristics, such as path-dependency, non-linearity, sensitive dependence on initial conditions, 'scale-free' qualities and emergent conditions such as 'strange attractors' and self-organisation.\n- For the purposes of this article, the salient aspect of such systems is the fundamental impossibility of fully describing such systems in deterministic terms. This results from the intersection of 'scale-free ' character and sensitivity to initial conditions - widely described as 'the butterfly effect'; the notion that from an apparently identical set of initial conditions two widely differing macro-states could deterministically develop, such that hurricane / no hurricane might result from the difference in position of a butterfly's wing. And further, that analysis of the relevant conditions around the butterfly's wing could be dependent upon the starting position of some particular molecule within the air around it, and so on.\n- This results in the stipulation that in complex dynamic systems, full availability of information is infeasible.\n(Heylighen, 2009; Heylighen, Cilliers, & Gershenson, 2007)\n\nWhich forces us to accept that:\n\n1.  'predictability' in the context of a complex system, is at best probabilistic.\n1. the outcome landscape of complex systems can be strongly contoured, with recurring patterns of interaction which can exhibit complex patterns of stability/instability (strange attractors).\n1. that the outcome of any intervention in such a system will inevitably involve some 'Unintended Consequences' (outcomes which may be, at a fundamental level, unpredictable in scope or kind, and unimaginable in character)."

Whether or not such a purpose exists belongs firmly in the realm of speculative philosophical musings.\n- Thus any value or utility function we consider must be accepted to have contingent status only; its worth only ever capable of assessment on the basis of some domain-specific criteria.\n- Thus any such assessment is always subject to alternative consideration from the perspective of some other domain.\n- Thus no particular domain can be considered as fundamental: the selection of an assessment domain can only ever have contingent status.\n- The question of human value is thus infinitely recursive and contingent - exhibiting the characteristics of a formally complex system."

It consists in the development of more-or-less abstract notions of aspects of lived experience and intentionally manipulating these within consciousness with the purpose of refining some aspect of the abstract notions under consideration. \n- We will call the manipulative aspect Rationalisation. \n- Rationalisation is not an action as such (beyond the apparent physical substrate of neurons, synapses, and the underlying physics of mental activity). For our purposes we will consider any deeper recursion of the physical substrate with the nature of Rationalisation as moot (without forgetting that this is an abstraction with significant inherent risks).\n- Rationalisation, being intentional and conscious, is always undertaken in the light of some purposive 'action-in-the-world' - however large the practical remove from such might be. To work in the mind on an absurdist poem is Rationalisation every bit as much as deciding which tree to chop down to build your house. (*See 'Conceptualising' below*).\n- For humans, 'action-in-the-world' cannot consist solely of Rationalisation, even in cases where the class of action has been most fully considered and decided in the Rational mode. All action requires mediation through non-rational modalities, operating at many layers (typically through the human body).\n- The relations between all human 'actions-in-the-world' and Rationalisation exhibit all the features of formally complex systems: non-linear, deeply interactive and recursive, exhibiting high sensitivity to initial conditions. In short, not susceptible of complete deterministic description. "

      "text": "- We will call the abstraction development mode 'Conceptualising'. \n- Conceptualising is in many ways best considered as a special class of 'action-in-the-world'; the physical reality of an abstract concept is no better understood than the physical reality of a thought-process - beyond the observation that both largely depend upon high-order processes in the structures of the brain. However, the persistence of mental abstractions suggests very strongly that, as distinct from the dynamic and impermanent activity of Rationalising, these have a permanent physical existence as patterns (probably highly dynamic and active) in the brain. \n- Thus the process of Conceptualising is a process of constructing something durable and specific in a physical environment (albeit one that is currently hardly distinguishable from the environment in which Rationalisation occurs) - an 'action-in-the-world'.\n- Conceptualising appears to be an activity undertaken both by conscious and unconscious processes - not exclusive to Rationalisation. This is evident just because the actual creation of the durable brain pattern that is an abstract concept relies upon all sorts of unconscious and biological processes over a dizzying number of layers, but more fundamentally because we know that less intelligent creatures such as birds, fish and even spiders have some forms of abstract conceptualisation. These creatures are not considered to be capable of Rationalisation in the sense that we are using the term. Additional evidence is supplied by studies of conceptual development in infant humans.\n- Abstract concepts are considered in this article as the protocol for traffic between the unconscious aspects of the brain and the conscious aspects. Both unconscious and conscious activities can result in the creation and refinement of abstract concepts - in conceptualisation. Alterations of the pattern of an abstract concept are accessible to and effective upon both the conscious and unconscious aspects of the brain."

However complicated they are, they are typically designed (whether by intention or through evolution) to behave predictably - to minimise Unintended Consequences to an extreme degree.\n- An argument can easily be constructed that no artefact of such a complex system as a human society can be truly simple - and indeed fiction is full of examples where an inherently simple object has unimaginable consequences as a result of its interaction with larger-scale human structures (for the want of a nail, a shoe was lost, for the want of a shoe, a horse was lost ... there is a folk wisdom around complexity).\n- For our purposes, though, we will take the meaning of tool to be 'fully deterministic in its behaviour, when used as intended', and, caveats accepted, also 'provably safe' - at least to the extent that the scope of adverse impacts from intended use are not expected to result in out-of-domain harm. In the case of a tool such as an ICBM, this is obviously questionable - which is of course why nuclear immolation is a perennial feature on lists of existential risks to human flourishing.\n\n"

These creatures are not considered to be capable of Rationalisation in the sense that we are using the term.\n- Abstract concepts are considered in this article as the protocol for traffic between the unconscious aspects of the brain and the conscious aspects. Both unconscious and conscious activities can result in the creation and refinement of abstract concepts - in conceptualisation.

Since AI is explicitly an effort to build some analogue of human-style intelligence, and since human-style intelligence is impossible to tease apart from human culture, any attempt to characterise AI research without attempting an understanding of the human-cultural aspects of the 'AI community' is likely to be inadequate."
