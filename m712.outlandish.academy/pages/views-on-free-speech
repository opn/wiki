However, I am not a free speech absolutist, and I think that people should be responsible for what they say. However, that doesn't mean shutting people down for what they say; rather, it means that you should be able to take responsibility for what you say anywhere. Now, that might involve being shut down, but there is an important distinction here: In our current society, some ideas are 'taboo', they cannot be spoken of at all. I believe that people should be able to talk about what they want to even if it offends somebody, provided that they do it without their titles and as an individual (that is, not representing a particular organization, company or group)."

      "text": "This is why anonymity is very important, and why I am a full supporter of Internet anonymity. When you are anonymous, your identity does not affect people's thinking when you're expressing an idea, and what you're expressing doesn't affect you. You are effectively disconnected from your expression. This creates an absolute meritocracy when discussing ideas; in that, what you say is not considered important because of you, but because people think it is logical and support it without prejudice. In contrast, social networks where your real life identity is tied to your account are bad places to discuss controversial ideas. Celebrities and people at the top are generally considered to be correct when they express something even if it actually is not, and what you say on a social media site might bite you, because your real life identity is now known by people who can use that information to damage your reputation/life/job. In fact, this has happened many times. People have been fired because of their opinions. This is why there is a need for an anonymous platform where the value of your ideas are based on the idea itself, not your identity."
