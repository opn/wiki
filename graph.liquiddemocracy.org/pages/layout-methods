        "text": "*In [[force-based layout]] systems, the graph drawing software modifies an initial vertex placement by continuously moving the vertices according to a system of forces based on physical metaphors related to systems of springs ([[spring (device)]]) or [[molecular mechanics]]. Typically, these systems combine attractive forces between adjacent vertices with repulsive forces between all pairs of vertices, in order to seek a layout in which edge lengths are small while vertices are well-separated. These systems may perform  [[gradient descent]] based minimization of an [[energy function]], or they may translate the forces directly into velocities or accelerations for the moving vertices."
