As an agreement, money lives in the same space as other social constructs like marriage or lease agreements.  These constructs are real, even if they only exist in people’s minds.  The money agreement can be made formally or informally, freely or by coercion, consciously or unconsciously.  Most of us do not consciously agree to use U.S. dollars, euros, or yens, for instance, nor do we consider their nature.  We just use them, unconsciously entering into an unspoken agreement with our banking system.   Any monetary agreement is only valid within a given community. Some monetary agreements are operational only among a small group of friends, like chips used in card games; for certain periods, like the cigarette medium of exchange among front-line soldiers during world war II; or within a larger community, like the citizens of one particular nation.   A community can be geographically disparate, such as Internet users, or can include large segments of the global community, as in the case of the U.S. dollar in its role as international reference currency."
